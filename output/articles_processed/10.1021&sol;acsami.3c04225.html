  <h2>
   1. Introduction
  </h2>
  <p>
   As one of the most important raw materials in the petrochemical industry, (1,2) C2H4 is widely used in producing synthetic fiber/plastic and other organic products. (3) However, some light hydrocarbon impurities, such as CH4, C2H2, C2H6, and so on, are obtained along with C2H4 by a petroleum cracking process at high temperature. (4,5) Therefore, it is necessary to separate and purify C2H4 from the light hydrocarbon mixtures. Cryogenic distillation technology is a high energy consumption process in the chemical industry, (6-8) and it is difficult to separate C2H4 from C2H6 and C2H2 due to their similar molecular sizes, boiling points, and physicochemical properties. (9-12) Therefore, more effective and energy-saving separation methods need to be explored to replace traditional high energy-consuming methods.
  </p>
  <p>
   The appearance of physical adsorbents is hopeful of greatly reducing the energy consumption of the purification process, which has the potential to replace traditional cryogenic distillation. (13-16) Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as novel porous materials can be precisely regulated and designed to obtain desired pore sizes and environments at the molecular level through crystal engineering approaches. (17-24) In general, most MOF materials exhibit the outstanding adsorption of unsaturated C2 hydrocarbons with the relationship of adsorption capacities and affinity order of C2H2 > C2H4 > C2H6 because introducing open metal sites/clusters or polar groups on the pore surfaces of MOFs can give priority to binding molecules with high dipole and/or quadrupole moments (quadrupole moments of 7.2 × 10-26 esu cm2 for C2H2, 1.5 × 10-26 esu cm2 for C2H4, and 0.65 × 10-26 esu cm2 for C2H6). (25-29) In addition, the kinetic diameter of C2H4 (4.163 Å) is between C2H6 (4.443 Å) and C2H2 (3.3 Å), so molecular sieving by adjusting the pore aperture cannot be implemented. (30) Therefore, the achievement of direct C2H4 separation in one step is a more challenging and desirable target (31-33) because high-purity C2H4 can be directly produced without an extra desorption step, thus avoiding a great deal of energy consumption. Compared with C2H4 and C2H2, C2H6 has the largest polarizability (39.3 × 10-25 cm3 for C2H2; 42.52 × 10-25 cm3 for C2H4; 44.7 × 10-25 cm3 for C2H6), and adsorbents for C2H6-selectivity need to contain rich nonpolar/inert surfaces, such as aromatic moieties, which facilitates the capture of gas molecules with high polarizability. (34-41)
  </p>
  <p>
   Along this line, we built a saturated trinuclear metal cluster [Co3(COO)6N3(μ3-OH)] to construct MOFs, which can diminish the affinity for C2H4 and C2H2, and a combination of a flexible ligand enriched with aromatic rings (4,4′,4″-(benzene-1,3,5-triyltris(oxy))triisophthalic acid = H6tipa) as well as 4,4′-bipyridine (bpy), an ultramicroporous MOF [Co3(μ3-OH)(tipa)(bpy)1.5] 3DMF 6H2O (1) with stand-alone one-dimensional (1D) square tubular channels that was successfully constructed. The MOF features nonpolar/inert pore surfaces enriched with plenty of aromatic rings, and the activation of 1 shows preferential adsorption of C2H6 compared to C2H4 and C2H2 in the low-pressure region, which is further verified by adsorption heats and selectivities. Moreover, transient breakthrough simulations suggest that the MOF can purify C2H4 from binary C2H6/C2H4 (50/50 and 10/90) and ternary C2H4/C2H6/C2H2 (89/10/1). The deep mechanism of C2H4 separation was studied by GCMC simulations.

   2.1. Materials and Methods
  </h2>
  <p>
   All reagents were obtained directly from suppliers and used without further purification. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data at room temperature were collected on an X-ray powder diffractometer (Bruker D8 ADVANCE) with a scan rate of 5.0° per minute in an air atmosphere. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out on a NETZSCH TG 209 thermal analyzer, which was heated at a rate of 10 °C min-1 from 30 to 800 °C and with a nitrogen condition. A Nicolet FTIR 170 SX spectrophotometer was used to record the Fourier transform infrared spectrum (FTIR). Elemental analyses were conducted on a PerkinElmer 2400C elemental analyzer. Gas and water vapor sorption measurements were performed using property testing and analyzed using a Quantachrome Autosorb-iQ MP apparatus.

   Co(NO3)2 6H2O (10.1 mg, 0.05 mmol), H6tipa (12.3 mg, 0.02 mmol), and bpy (3.2 mg, 0.02 mmol) were added to a mixture of 2.5 mL of DMF and 0.5 mL of deionized water. Then, the mixture was mixed into a Teflon-lined stainless steel (25 mL) container and heated at 120 °C for 72 h. After reducing to room temperature at a speed of 10 °C h-1, the purple-red cube-shaped crystals were obtained in 49.5% yield. Anal. calcd. (%) for C54 H58 Co3 N6 O25: C, 47.42; H, 4.27; N, 6.14.

   2.3. X-ray Crystallography
  </h2>
  <p>
   A Bruker SMART APEX II CCD detector was employed to calculate the single-crystal X-ray diffraction data of 1 with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.54184 Å) at 170 K. The structure of 1 was solved by the direct methods and refined by the full-matrix least-squares methods based on F2 by the SHELXTL (42) software package. The non-hydrogen atoms of the framework were refined anisotropically, whereas all the hydrogen atoms were geometrically located and were refined isotropically. As the solvent molecules of the data in 1 cannot be located, the SQUEEZE routine of PLATON (43) was applied in refining. The selected crystallographic data are summarized in Table S2, and the CCDC number for 1 is 2233223.
  </p>
  <h2>
   3. Results and Discussion
  </h2>
  <h2>
   3.1. Crystal Structure of 1
  </h2>
  <p>
   Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that 1 crystallizes in the trigonal system with the P43n space group featuring 1D square tubular channels. The asymmetric unit consists of one Co(II) ion, one-third of the tipa ligand, one-half of the bpy ligand, and a third of μ3-OH. Each Co(II) is located in a slightly distorted octahedral geometry, linked by one μ3-OH oxygen atom, four carboxylic oxygen atoms (Co1-O = 2.0528(18) to 2.137(7) Å) from three different tipa ligands, and a nitrogen atom (Co1-N = 2.154(8) Å) from one bpy ligand (Table S3 and Figure S1a). The adjacent Co1 atoms are further bridged via μ3-OH and deprotonated carboxylate possessing the same μ2-η1:η1 coordination modes to generate a trinuclear cluster SBU of [Co3(COO)6N3(μ3-OH)] (Figure 1a and Figure S1b). Moreover, the trinuclear cluster joint ligand results in a 3D porous framework with stand-alone 1D square tubular channels along the a, b, and c axis (Figure 1b,c), which have ultramicropore sizes of 4.8 Å and a porosity of 28.7% calculated by PLATON (43) using the contact surface and a probe radius of 1.2 Å. Importantly, these 1D square tubular channels are enriched with plenty of aromatic rings causing nonpolar/inert pore surfaces, which would be in favor of adsorbing higher polarizability of gas molecules. From the topological perspective, the trinuclear cluster of [Co3(COO)6N3(μ3-OH)] can be viewed as a 9-connected node, and the benzene ring in the middle of the ligand and carboxyl benzene of the ligand both can be regarded as 3-connected nodes. Thus, the whole framework exhibits a trinodal (3,3,9)-connected network with the point symbol of (4.5.7)3(43.59.66.715.83)(43) (Figure 1d).
  </p>
  <h2>
   3.2. PXRD and TGA
  </h2>
  <p>
   The experimental PXRD pattern of 1 is in excellent agreement with the simulated pattern obtained from the single-crystal X-ray diffraction data, revealing the phase purity (Figure S3). Additionally, PXRD of samples exposed to air for half a year is consistent with the simulated pattern, which indicates that 1 has good stability in air (Figure S3). TGA shows a weight loss of about 6.9% caused by the loss of the six free water molecules (calcd. 6.7%) before 115 °C. Then, a weight loss of 13.0% from 115 to 260 °C corresponds to the loss of three guest DMF molecules (calcd. 13.7%). Further heating to 340 °C induced structural decomposition (Figure S4).
  </p>
  <h2>
   3.3. Sorption and Separation Performances
  </h2>
  <p>
   Before evaluating the porosity of 1, the CH2Cl2-exchanged samples were heated at 120 °C for 8 h under vacuum to remove the free solvent molecules, and PXRD and TGA denote the stability of the activated samples and removal of guest molecules. Moreover, the color of the samples changed from light red to dark purple during the solvent removal process, which may be because removal of polar solvents leads to the transfer of electrons in the ligand so as to absorb or radiate a certain wavelength of light (Figure S5). The N2 sorption isotherm at 77 K is measured to confirm the permanent porosity of 1a (Figure 2a). The type-I isotherm adsorption behavior of ultramicroporous materials with a saturation uptake of 118.1 cm3 g-1 is revealed. However, the N2 adsorption isotherm at 77 K does not show a plateau, which may be because large pores are formed by accumulation between crystal particles, causing nitrogen to be adsorbed all the time, and the phenomenon does not affect the values of surface areas and pore size distribution. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Langmuir surface areas of 1a are measured to be 408.4 and 446.8 m2 g-1, respectively. The pore size distribution is around 4.8 Å calculated by the Horvath-Kawazoe method, coinciding with the sizes of the aperture. A pore volume of 0.183 cm3 g-1 assessed at P/P0 ≈ 0.99 is almost equal to the value of 0.207 cm3 g-1 obtained from the crystal structure. In addition, the hydrophobic character of the pore surface of 1a that covers abundant aromatic π-systems was verified by the type-V water sorption isotherm tested at 298 K (Figure S6). (44)
  </p>
  <p>
   The nonpolar/inert pore surface and narrow pore size inspired us to research gas adsorption performance of the C2 hydrocarbons. To ensure accuracy of the data, the adsorption isotherms of 1a for C2H6, C2H4, and C2H2 were recorded three times at 273, 288, and 298 K, respectively, and isotherms with error bars are shown in Figures S8 and S9. To clearly compare the adsorption performance in the low pressure, Figure 2c,f and Figure S7b are drawn on the log scale. Under 100 kPa, 1a shows the highest C2H2 loadings (77.0 and 54.8 cm3 cm-3) compared with C2H6 (54.0 and 41.6 cm3 cm-3) and C2H4 (55.7 and 42.4 cm3 cm-3) at 273 and 298 K (Figure 2b,c,e,f), respectively, due to the critical temperature of C2H2 (35.15 °C), higher than those of C2H6 (32.25 °C) and C2H4 (9.45 °C). However, the gas adsorption amount of C2H6 is higher than those of C2H4 and C2H2 in the low-pressure location (below 15.3 kPa at 298 K and 5.1 kPa at 273 K). Furthermore, the C2H6 adsorption isotherm presents a steeper curve than those of C2H4 and C2H2 in the low-pressure region at different temperatures, indicating the stronger binding between C2H6 and the framework. The result shows that 1a is the preferential adsorption for C2H6 compared to C2H4 and C2H2, and the peculiar reversed adsorption phenomenon is different from the vast majority of reported MOFs. This rare phenomenon broke the traditional understanding of the relationship between C2 hydrocarbons.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, the C2H6 and C2H4 adsorption uptake values at 100 kPa are higher than those of some reported famous MOFs, such as NUM-3a (298 K: 20.4 cm3 cm-3 for C2H6 and 28.9 cm3 cm-3 for C2H4; 273 K: 23.0 cm3 cm-3 for C2H6 and 34.9 cm3 cm-3 for C2H4), (45) BSF-2 (34.1 cm3 cm-3 for C2H6 at 298 K), (46) and UPC-33 (32.7 cm3 cm-3 for C2H6 at 298 K), (47) but these are still lower than those of iso-MOF-4 (71.6 cm3 cm-3 for C2H6 at 298 K), (48) Azole-Th-1 (298 K: 132.5 cm3 cm-3 for C2H6 and 106.7 cm3 cm-3 for C2H4), (49) and NIIC-20-Pr (88.3 cm3 cm-3 for C2H4 at 273 K). (50) Meanwhile, the adsorption capacity of C2H2 at 298 K is lower than ZNU-6 (193.8 cm3 cm-3) (51) but far higher than those of JLU-Liu33F (14.5 cm3 cm-3) (52) and UPC-71 (25.1 cm3 cm-3). (53)
  </p>
  <p>
   To further understand the unique reverse adsorption phenomenon, the gas affinities toward C2 hydrocarbons are estimated with the adsorption heat (Qst) value calculated from single-component isotherms at 273, 288, and 298 K by utilizing the virial equation. The sequence of the Qst values is C2H6 (37.2 kJ mol-1) > C2H2 (35.1 kJ mol-1) > C2H4 (33.6 kJ mol-1) at zero loading (Figure 2d), which is consistent with uptake values at the low-pressure region and the steepness of the isotherms because the Qst value at zero loading is the most energetically favored site in the framework interacting with gas molecules. The Qst of C2H6 are higher than those of C2H2 and C2H4 below a loading of 27.6 cm3 g-1, suggesting the small pore size and aromatic rings in 1a that lead to a stronger C2H6 binding affinity. Then, the Qst value for C2H6 is still greater than that for C2H4 with the increase in gas loadings, and the final order of Qst values is C2H2 > C2H6 > C2H4. Notably, the Qst value of C2H6 at zero loading is higher than those of famous MOFs, such as CAU-11 (31.0 kJ mol-1), (54) BUT-315-a (33.4 kJ mol-1), (55) JXNU-9 (23.6 kJ mol-1), (56) and Fe2(BDP)3 (23.9 kJ mol-1) (57) and lower than those of MAF-49 (60 kJ mol-1) (58) and NKMOF-8-Br (40.8 kJ mol-1). (59) In addition, the Clausius-Clapeyron equation was also used to obtain the isosteric heat of adsorption. The Qst of C2H6, C2H4, and C2H2 lie in the ranges of 40.8-30.8, 37.3-30.1, and 34.9-28.6 kJ mol-1, respectively, which show a similar trend with those acquired from the virial equation (Figure 2d).
  </p>
  <p>
   The ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) was employed to calculate the selectivity for C2H6/C2H4 mixtures at 298 K. Derived by Myers and Prausnitz, (60) the IAST is a method for predicting the adsorption equilibria for components in a mixture, using only single-component adsorption data at the same temperature and on the same adsorbent. IAST is based on three assumptions: (i) the same surface area is available to all adsorbates, (ii) the adsorbent is inert, and (iii) the multicomponent mixture behaves as an ideal solution at constant spreading pressure and temperature. The selectivity for equimolar C2H6/C2H4 mixtures is 1.30 at 298 K and 100 kPa (Figure 3a). Although this C2H6/C2H4 selectivity at 298 K is lower than some famous MOFs, such as BUT-315-a (2.35), (55) MIL-142A (1.5), (61) and Zn-FBA (2.9), (62) it is comparable to Zn-atz-oba (1.27) (63) and LIFM-28 (1.24). (64) In addition, the separation potential (Δq = q1y2/y1 - q2) is utilized to further assess C2H6/C2H4 separation performance, which as a comprehensive index integrating adsorption capacity and selectivity is proposed by Krishna first (65) and provides a convenient and simple indicator for the separation ability of MOFs based on IAST. The Δq values for 50/50 and 10/90 mixtures of C2H6/C2H4 are 0.18 and 0.38 mmol g-1 at 298 K and 100 kPa (Figure 3b), respectively. These results reflect that 1a could efficiently separate C2H4 from the C2H6/C2H4 mixture at an ambient environment.
  </p>
  <h2>
   3.4. Breakthrough Simulations
  </h2>
  <p>
   To further confirm the C2H4 separation performance of 1a for industrial components, the transient breakthrough simulations for 50/50 and 10/90 mixtures of C2H6/C2H4 as well as 89/10/1 mixtures of C2H4/C2H6/C2H2 were conducted at 298 K. The simulation methodology is described in earlier works, (66,67) and details are provided in the Supporting Information. For 50/50 and 10/90 mixtures of C2H6/C2H4, C2H4 first appeared at the outlet of the column, while C2H6 breakthrough occurred after calculations of 32.4 and 32.9 mL g-1, respectively (Figure 4a,b). Moreover, 89/10/1 mixtures of C2H4/C2H6/C2H2 pass through the bed with the sequence of C2H4, C2H2, and C2H6 (Figure 4c), indicating that C2H4 can also be effectively separated from C2H4/C2H6/C2H2 mixtures.
  </p>
  <h2>
   3.5. Molecular Simulations
  </h2>
  <p>
   To gain an insight into the unique reversed adsorption mechanism, grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations were performed to research binding sites of C2 hydrocarbons in 1a at 298 K and 5 kPa. The C2H6 molecule is almost located in the center of the pore and connects with two opposite benzene ring stems from two tipa ligands and one pyridine ring from the bpy ligand through three C-HC2H6 πaromatic rings interactions (HC2H6 πaromatic rings = 2.71-4.22 Å) (Figure 5a), which are less than/comparable with the sum of the van der Waals radii of hydrogen (1.20 Å) and carbon (1.70 Å) atoms, demonstrating strong attractive interactions. Different from the C2H6 molecule, the C2H4 and C2H2 molecules locate at the corner of the channel and interact with the pyridine ring from bpy ligands to generate weak πC2H4/C2H2 πbpy interactions (πC2H4/C2H2 πbpy = 3.68-3.72 Å) through π-electrons in the unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds of guests (Figure 5b,c). For C2H2, there is also a πC2H2 πtipa interaction (πC2H2 πtipa = 3.51 Å) formed by the C2H2 molecule with one benzene ring (Figure 5c). As a result, the shortest and most number of C-H π interactions between C2H6 and the framework coincide with the steepest adsorption isotherms and the highest Qst value of C2H6. Interestingly, it is found that adjacent C2H2 in channels form intermolecular interactions with each other by HC2H2 πC2H2 contacts (2.75-3.00 Å) at 298 K and 100 kPa (Figure S14), indicating that the narrow channels enhance the potential fields for C2H2 molecules and result in C2H2 packing, coinciding with the highest C2H2 adsorption amount under high pressure.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, the particular reversed adsorption phenomenon can be further supported by the energy distribution curves of 1a. The order of energy values (C2H6 (8.55 kcal/mol) > C2H2 (7.65 kcal/mol) > C2H4 (7.25 kcal/mol)) is in line with Qst values (Figure 5d).
  </p>
  <h2>
   4. Conclusions
  </h2>
  <p>
   In summary, a nonpolar/inert MOF with an ultramicroporous aperture decorated with plenty of aromatic rings was successfully prepared, which realizes highly reversed separation of C2H4 from C2 hydrocarbons. The particular pore environment and suitable pore aperture of 1a lead to a stronger interaction for C2H6 than those of C2H4 and C2H2, which can be well supported by adsorption heat, C2H6/C2H4 selectivity, favorable breakthrough simulations, and molecular simulation. This contribution will facilitate the design and construction of nonpolar/inert MOFs for challenging C2H4 separation from C2 hydrocarbon mixtures.
