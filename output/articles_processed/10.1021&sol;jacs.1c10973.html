   High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlidePurification of C2H4 from a ternary C2H2/C2H6/C2H4 mixture by one-step adsorption separation is of prime importance but challenging in the petrochemical industry; however, effective strategies to design high-performance adsorbents are lacking. We herein report for the first time the incorporation of Lewis basic sites into a C2H6-selective MOF, enabling efficient one-step production of polymer-grade C2H4 from ternary mixtures. Introduction of amino groups into highly stable C2H6-selective UiO-67 can not only partition large pores into smaller cagelike pockets to provide suitable pore confinement but also offer additional binding sites to simultaneously enhance C2H2 and C2H6 adsorption capacities over C2H4. The amino-functionalized UiO-67-(NH2)2 thus exhibits exceptionally high C2H2 and C2H6 uptakes as well as benchmark C2H2/C2H4 and C2H6/C2H4 selectivities, surpassing all of the C2H2/C2H6-selective materials reported so far. Theoretical calculations combined with in situ infrared spectroscopy indicate that the synergetic effect of suitable pore confinement and functional surfaces decorated with amino groups provides overall stronger multipoint van der Waals interactions with C2H2 and C2H6 over C2H4. The exceptional performance of UiO-67-(NH2)2 was evidenced by breakthrough experiments for C2H2/C2H6/C2H4 mixtures under dry and wet conditions, providing a remarkable C2H4 productivity of 0.55 mmol g-1 at ambient conditions.

   Introduction
  </h2>
  <p>
   Ethylene (C2H4) is one of the most important petrochemical intermediates and is currently the largest consumed in the world, with production capacity exceeding 170 million tons in 2017. (1) Currently, ethylene is generally obtained through steam cracking and thermal decomposition of either naphtha or ethane (C2H6), in which acetylene (C2H2) and C2H6 inevitably coexist as downstream byproducts. The separation of C2H2 and C2H6 from C2H4 is a critical process to yield polymer-grade C2H4 ( > 99.9% purity). (2) In the current petrochemical industry, acetylene is first removed through catalytic hydrogenation using noble-metal catalysts or solvent extraction of cracked olefins using organic solvents, and ethane is subsequently separated from C2H4 by conventional cryogenic distillation. (3) These step-by-step purification processes are complicated, environmentally unfriendly, and energy intensive. The total energy used for purification of ethylene and propene even accounts for 0.3% of global energy consumption. (4) Such a high energy footprint has spurred extensive research into the development of more energy-efficient approaches for C2H4 purification.
  </p>
  <p>
   The implementation of adsorbent-based separation technology has been considered as a promising route toward mitigating the high energy consumption associated with chemical separations. (5) In this regard, porous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), also known as porous coordination polymers (PCPs), have emerged as promising candidates for hydrocarbon gas separations due to their powerful predictability and tunability on pore size and functionality. (6) While a number of MOFs have been developed to address the efficient separation of C2H4 from binary C2H2/C2H4 or C2H6/C2H4 mixtures, (7) simultaneous removal of both C2H2 and C2H6 from ternary C2H2/C2H6/C2H4 mixtures would be more desired due to the simplicity of directly producing pure C2H4 in one step at the outlet but remains a daunting challenge for a single adsorbent. The fundamental challenge mainly stems from the respective kinetic diameters (C2H2: 3.3 Å, C2H4: 4.1 Å, C2H6: 4.4 Å), quadrupole moments (7.2 × 10-26 vs 1.5 × 10-26 vs 0.65 × 10-26 esu cm2), and polarizabilities (39.3 × 10-25 vs 42.52 × 10-25 vs 44.7 × 10-25 cm3) of these C2 gases, wherein all physicochemical properties of C2H4 lie between C2H2 and C2H6, which hampers most physisorbents from being highly selective. (8)
  </p>
  <p>
   Since larger quadrupole moments and more π electrons of C2 gases enable a stronger interaction with metals or highly polar groups, the expected trend in adsorption affinity for C2 gases in most MOFs typically follows the sequence of C2H2 > C2H4 > C2H6. However, one-step purification of C2H4 from ternary C2 mixtures would require physisorbents to show stronger affinity toward both C2H2 and C2H6 over C2H4. With respect to C2H2/C2H4 separation, most MOFs can readily fulfill the preferential adsorption of C2H2 over C2H4 with high selectivities through the strategies of fine-tuning pore size or incorporating highly polar groups (e.g.. open metal sites). (9,10) However, such design strategies are apt to result in the preferential adsorption of C2H4 over C2H6 and thus be unable to realize one-step C2H4 purification (Scheme 1a), as exemplified by the well-known MOF-74 and SIFSIX materials. (11,12) On the other hand, by virtue of the higher polarizability of ethane over ethylene, some C2H6-selective MOFs with well-designed C2H6-affinity sites or inert pore surfaces have been successfully exploited to show benchmark C2H6/C2H4 separation. (13-15) Unfortunately, such nonpolar/inert pore structures are also detrimental to C2H2 adsorption and recognition because of its low polarizability among the C2 gases. In this context, most C2H6-selective MOFs exhibit relatively low C2H2 uptake and insufficient C2H2/C2H4 selectivity that cannot differentiate the two gases. By far, only a few C2H6-selective MOFs have been discovered unexpectedly without any rational design to enable the preferential adsorption of both C2H2 and C2H6 over C2H4; (16-21) however, they suffer from poor C2H2/C2H4 or C2H6/C2H4 selectivity ( < 1.5) and, thus, a quite limited one-step separation performance, as exemplified by Azole-Th-1 and NPU-2 with almost identical C2H2 and C2H4 adsorption capacities. These inherent contradictions make the design of a material with both high C2H2/C2H4 and C2H6/C2H4 selectivities a daunting challenge, and there is still a lack of effective strategies to design satisfactory adsorbents for this separation.
  </p>
  <p>
   To overcome this challenge, we proposed two design strategies to target one-step C2H4 purification based on C2H2- or C2H6-selective MOFs (Scheme 1), respectively. However, it is almost impossible for C2H2-selective MOFs to individually reduce C2H4 adsorption so as to realize the preferential adsorption of both C2H2 and C2H6 over C2H4 (Scheme 1a). On the other hand, the immobilization of some C2H2-affinity sites into C2H6-selective MOFs seems to be a feasible strategy to enhance C2H2 adsorption and separation without sacrificing high C2H6/C2H4 separation (Scheme 1b). Since the C2H2 molecule (pKa = 26) is more acidic than C2H4 (45) and C2H6 (62), some Lewis basic groups, such as amino or nitrogen sites, have been well demonstrated to be capable of efficiently boosting C2H2 adsorption and separation capacities. (22) We thus deduced that if we incorporate appropriate basic sites onto inert pore surfaces of C2H6-selective MOFs, it is highly possible to achieve simultaneously high C2H2/C2H4 and C2H6/C2H4 separation in a single adsorbent. To verify this hypothesis, we herein selected Zr-based MOFs as the framework platform for proof of principle. This is because Zr-based MOFs have been realized to exhibit the preferential binding of ethane over ethylene due to their inert pore surfaces. (19,23) This type of MOF also represents one of the most promising water-stable materials for broad applications because of the structure variety and tunability, (24) enabling them to be promising candidates for this purpose. Through a comprehensive screening of the structures of Zr-MOFs, we selected UiO-67 as the fundamental framework backbone for the following amino (-NH2) functionalization because of its inert pore surfaces, large pore sizes, and easy functionalization on the ligand. We found that the immobilization of -NH2 groups into stable UiO-67 not only segments large pores into smaller cavities but also provides additional binding sites to dually enforce C2H2 and C2H6 binding affinity over C2H4. As expected, the amino-functionalized UiO-67-(NH2)2 exhibits notably enhanced C2H2 and C2H6 adsorption capacities, wherein the uptake trend in the order C2H6 > C2H4 > C2H2 for UiO-67 was in turn C2H2 > C2H6 > C2H4 for UiO-67-(NH2)2. Most importantly, UiO-67-(NH2)2 displays not only record high C2H2 and C2H6 uptakes (5.90 and 5.32 mmol g-1) but also benchmark 1/99 C2H2/C2H4 (2.1) and 50/50 C2H6/C2H4 (1.7) selectivities at ambient conditions, whose selectivities outperform the previously best-performing TJT-100 (1.8 and 1.2), (16) Azole-Th-1 (1 and 1.46), (17) and NPU-2 (1.25 and 1.52). (20) One-step removal of C2H2 and C2H6 from dry and wet C2H2/C2H6/C2H4 (1/49.5/49.5) mixtures to produce polymer-grade C2H4 was evidenced by breakthrough experiments on UiO-67-(NH2)2 at 298 K and 1.0 bar.

  <h2>
   Results and Discussion
  </h2>
  <p>
   In choosing a suitable framework, it was of paramount importance to find a C2H6-selective material with high stability and easy functionalization. We here selected highly stable and adjustable UiO-67 as the platform for the -NH2 functionalization. The UiO-67 and amino-functionalized UiO-67-(NH2)2 samples were readily synthesized as microcrystalline powders according to the previously reported literatures with slight modification. (25) The phase purity and crystallinity of bulk UiO-67 and UiO-67-(NH2)2 were confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). Despite extensive attempts, we were not able to obtain single crystals of UiO-67-(NH2)2 for single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies. The PXRD patterns indicate that UiO-67-(NH2)2 would have a structure similar to that of UiO-67 (Figure S1). Therefore, structural determination was conducted on UiO-67-(NH2)2 through powder diffractometry using a direct method (Figure S2). (26) We modeled its structure using the same framework connection as UiO-67 and then optimized the orientation of phenyl rings (see the Supporting Information for more details). The simulated PXRD patterns of our structural model agree well with the experimental data and also with the structure model reported in the literature (Figure S3), (25b) strongly supporting its validity. Detailed structure information on UiO-67-(NH2)2 is provided in Tables S1 and S2.
  </p>
  <p>
   As shown in Figure 1, the framework of UiO-67-(NH2)2 is isostructural to the net in UiO-67 with the same fcu topology. Structural analyses of the two frameworks indicate that each of the Zr6O4(OH)4 SBUs is coordinated to 12 carboxylate ligands in which the carbon atoms act as points of extension to form the 3D networks, and the triangular faces of the Zr6-octahedron are alternatively capped by μ3-O and μ3-OH groups. Such coordination models enable each zirconium atom to be fully occupied, and no polar open metal sites (OMSs) exist in the two frameworks. As shown in Figure 1b,c, UiO-67 possesses two types of large cages: one tetrahedral cage of 11.5 Å in diameter and another octahedral cage with pore diameter of 17.5 Å. The incorporation of two -NH2 groups into the linker of UiO-67 was found to remarkably alter the pore characteristics in the resulting UiO-67-(NH2)2. First, the diameter of the octahedral cage is significantly decreased from 17.5 Å in UiO-67 to 11.5 Å in UiO-67-(NH2)2 because of numerous -NH2 groups pointing into the cage (Figure 1c). Second, the tetrahedral cage can be divided into small cagelike pockets by the incorporated -NH2 groups: one squashed cage of ~7.1 Å at the center and four small pockets of ~5.2 Å at the corners of the tetrahedral pore. It is worthy of note that each of such small pockets is constructed of three phenyl rings, three carboxylate groups, and three -NH2 groups with a diameter size of 5.2 Å, which provides suitable pore confinement with multipoint binding sites for C2 adsorption. Most importantly, the decorated -NH2 groups have been demonstrated to be capable of improving C2H2 uptake and C2H2/C2H4 selectivity significantly. (22) These optimized small pockets and functional pore surfaces decorated with -NH2 groups, thus exhibiting the potential to provide more suitable pore confinement effects toward C2H2 and C2H6 molecules over C2H4.

   The pore characteristics of the activated UiO-67 and UiO-67-(NH2)2 were obtained by nitrogen (N2) gas sorption experiments at 77 K, respectively. As shown in Figure 2a, both of the materials show the fully reversible sorption behavior without any hysteresis. The saturated N2 uptake of UiO-67-(NH2)2 is 514 cm3 g-1, which is notably lower than that of UiO-67 (806 cm3 g-1) due to the introduction of -NH2 groups. Accordingly, the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of UiO-67-(NH2)2 is decreased from 2815 m2 g-1 in UiO-67 to 2022 m2 g-1, and the pore volume calculated based on saturated N2 uptake is also decreased from 1.25 cm3 g-1 in UiO-67 to 0.80 cm3 g-1. Further, the pore size distribution, determined by the non-local density functional theory (NLDFT) model, also exhibits the same decrease trend, with values from 10.9 and 21.6 Å in UiO-67 to 6.8/7.5 and 10.5 Å in UiO-67-(NH2)2, which are consistent with the calculated geometric pore size distributions (PSD) from the crystal structure (Figure S5). We note that the overhigh N2 uptake and mesopores observed in UiO-67 imply that defects might exist in the UiO-67 sample. (25a) The presence of missing-linker defects was thus examined by TGA curves according to the previously reported methods. (25,27) The defective linker numbers per Zr6 formula unit for the synthesized UiO-67 and UiO-67-(NH2)2 were estimated to be 1.05 and 0.10 (Figure S6), respectively.
  </p>
  <p>
   Single-component adsorption isotherms of C2H2, C2H6, and C2H4 for both UiO-67 and UiO-67-(NH2)2 were examined at 273, 296, and 313 K up to 1 bar, respectively (Figures 2b and S9-S12). As shown in Figure 2b, owing to the inert pore surfaces, UiO-67 shows a preferential adsorption of C2H6 over C2H4. The C2H6 uptake is relatively low with a value of 3.05 mmol g-1 at 296 K and 1 bar but higher than that of C2H4 (2.13 mmol g-1). However, the C2H2 uptake (2.09 mmol g-1) is the lowest among the C2 gases, making this material unable to discriminate between C2H2 and C2H4. Given that relatively high defects commonly exist in the structure of UiO-67, we thus synthesized a series of UiO-67 samples with various contents of missing-linker defects (from 0.06 to 1.45) by the reported methods, (25) so as to examine its possible effect on gas adsorption. As shown in Figure S8, the C2H2 and C2H6 adsorption capacities of these UiO-67 samples revealed that the variation on defect concentration shows no obvious effect on gas adsorption. After the incorporation of -NH2 groups into UiO-67, the resulting UiO-67-(NH2)2 exhibits a dramatically enhanced gas uptake for all C2 gases, probably attributed to the contracted pore sizes and -NH2 groups that result in a stronger binding affinity toward these gases. Most importantly, UiO-67-(NH2)2 shows the obviously preferential binding of both C2H2 and C2H6 over C2H4 at 296 K and 1 bar, with the values in the sequence of C2H2 (5.90 mmol g-1) > C2H6 (5.32 mmol g-1) > C2H4 (4.32 mmol g-1). The incorporation of -NH2 groups thus enables the C2H2 uptake capacity to be notably increased from the lowest in UiO-67 to the highest in UiO-67-(NH2)2. We further note that both C2H2 and C2H6 uptakes of UiO-67-(NH2)2 at ambient conditions are placed among the highest values for all the C2H2/C2H6-selective MOFs reported so far (Figure 2c), far exceeding those of most benchmark MOFs such as NPU-1 (5.09 and 4.50 mmol g-1), (20) TJT-100 (4.46 and 3.75 mmol g-1), (16) and Azole-Th-1 (3.62 and 4.47 mmol g-1). (17) These adsorption discrepancies of UiO-67 and UiO-67-(NH2)2 can be partially explained by the experimental isosteric heat of adsorption (Qst). As shown in Figures S13 and S14, the Qst values of UiO-67-(NH2)2 for all the C2 gases are much higher than those of UiO-67, indicating that the immobilization of -NH2 groups can strengthen the gas-binding affinity. Further, the initial Qst of UiO-67-(NH2)2 increases in the order of C2H4 (24.5 kJ mol-1) < C2H6 (26.5 kJ mol-1) < C2H2 (27.4 kJ mol-1), in contrast to the trend of C2H2 (23.3 kJ mol-1) ≈ C2H4 (23.2 kJ mol-1) < C2H6 (24.7 kJ mol-1) observed in UiO-67 (Figure S15). These results are consistent with those of C2 gas uptakes.
  </p>
  <p>
   We utilized ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) to calculate the adsorptive selectivity of UiO-67-(NH2)2 for both 1/99 C2H2/C2H4 and 50/50 C2H6/C2H4 mixtures and compared with those of UiO-67. As depicted in Figure 2d, UiO-67 exhibits a relatively low C2H6/C2H4 selectivity of 1.49 and a negligible C2H2/C2H4 selectivity of 1.07 at 296 K and 1 bar due to the very close C2H2 and C2H4 adsorption isotherms. After the incorporation of -NH2 groups into the framework, UiO-67-(NH2)2 exhibits a drastically enhanced C2H2/C2H4 selectivity of 2.1 (Figure 2d). To the best of our knowledge, this selectivity is among the highest in all of the reported C2H2/C2H6-selective MOFs (Figure 2e), notably higher than that of the benchmark NPU-1 (1.4), (20) Azole-Th-1 (1.0), (17) and TJT-100 (1.8). (16) Similarly, the C2H6/C2H4 selectivity can be also improved from 1.49 in UiO-67 to 1.7 in UiO-67-(NH2)2, which is also the highest among the related MOFs (Figure 2f). It is worthy of note that high C2H2 and C2H6 uptakes are also very important to determine the separation performance for one-step C2H4 purification. As shown in Figure 2e,f, when we set the gas uptake and selectivity as concurrent objectives, UiO-67-(NH2)2 shows the best gas uptakes and selectivities for both C2H2/C2H4 and C2H6/C2H4 separations among all the related MOFs reported, setting up a new benchmark for one-step C2H2/C2H6/C2H4 separation.
  </p>
  <p>
   To elucidate the origin of remarkably enhanced gas uptakes and selectivities of UiO-67-(NH2)2, we performed grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations on both UiO-67 and UiO-67-(NH2)2 to investigate the interactions between the framework and C2 gas molecule (see Supporting Information for the simulation details). The calculated C2 adsorption isotherms are shown in Figure S23, in which both adsorbed tendency and adsorption amount for C2 gases are in good agreement with the experimental results. As shown in Figures 3a-d and S24, we found that, for all of the C2 molecules, the primary adsorption sites for both UiO-67 and UiO-67-(NH2)2 are located at the corner of the tetrahedral pores. For clarity, we only showed one adsorbed gas molecule at the corner site. As expected, the interactions between C2 molecules and the nonpolar pore surfaces are of the van der Waals type, all of which are modest and listed in Table S9 in detail. In UiO-67, each C2H6 molecule interacts with three phenyl rings from three linkers and four oxygen atoms from three carboxylic groups to form four C-H π (H π, 3.20-3.50 Å) and four C-H O (H O, 3.26-3.57 Å) interactions (Figure S24). Both C2H4 and C2H2 molecules show fewer C-H π and C-H O interactions (Figures 3a and S24 and Table S9). Thus, the binding of C2H6 is notably stronger than that of C2H4 and C2H2, consistent with the experimental Qst values in the order of C2H6 > C2H4 ≈ C2H2. After the -NH2 functionalization, the large tetrahedral pore can be partitioned by -NH2 groups to form small pore pockets at each corner site, which provides more suitable pore confinement and additional binding sites for this C2 adsorption. The density distribution maps of C2 adsorption by GCMC simulations further reveal that the small pore pockets at each corner site are the primary adsorption sites for C2 molecules (Figure S25). As shown in Figure 3c, the C2H6 molecule absorbed in UiO-67-(NH2)2 interacts not only with three phenyl rings and six oxygen atoms to form five C-H π interactions (H π, 3.43-4.00 Å) and eight C-H O (H O, 3.05-3.82 Å) but also with three -NH2 groups to form three C-H N (H N, 3.50-4.25 Å) interactions, whose binding strength is much stronger than that of UiO-67. For the C2H2 molecule, besides the similar C-H π and C-H O interactions compared with UiO-67, the C2H2 molecule binds with three -NH2 groups to form an additional three C-H N (H N, 3.83-4.80 Å) and three N-H C (H C, 4.29-4.74 Å) interactions (Figure 3b). In contrast, there are only two additional C-H N (H N, 3.48-3.98 Å) interactions formed by the C2H4 molecule with -NH2 groups (Figure 3d). Evidently, the incorporation of -NH2 groups facilitates the framework to bind more strongly with C2H2 and C2H6 over with C2H4, thus leading to the higher C2H2 and C2H6 binding energy than that of C2H4 in UiO-67-(NH2)2. The static binding energies for C2H2, C2H6, and C2H4 at the binding sites were calculated to be 26.4, 25.7, and 23.4 kJ mol-1, respectively, which are consistent with the experimental Qst values (27.4, 26.5, and 24.5 kJ mol-1). These calculation results are fully consistent with our experimental findings discussed earlier.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT-D) calculations were carried out to further evaluate the gas binding of C2 molecules in UiO-67 and UiO-67-(NH2)2. As with the GCMC simulations, all three C2 gas molecules are preferentially adsorbed at the corners of the tetrahedral pores in both UiO-67 and UiO-67-(NH2)2 (Figure S27) and interact with phenyl rings from linkers and oxygen atoms from carboxylic groups, but the introduced -NH2 groups can provide additional adsorption sites in UiO-67-(NH2)2, thus leading to stronger binding compared with UiO-67. In UiO-67-(NH2)2, on the one hand, there are more van der Waals type interactions between C2H2 or C2H6 molecules and pore surfaces at the corner sites; on the other hand, there exist additional strong surface sites for C2H2 except for the corner site (Figure S27a), located adjacent to the -NH2 groups within the tetrahedral pores, which is partly responsible for significantly enhanced C2H2 uptake in UiO-67-(NH2)2. The calculated static binding energies are 33.1, 34.2, and 28.8 kJ mol-1 for C2H2, C2H6, and C2H4 in UiO-67-(NH2)2, respectively, notably higher than the corresponding values found in UiO-67 (27.9, 29.8, and 28.3 kJ mol-1). These values further confirm the van der Waals nature of the gas interaction with the pore surface and are in qualitative agreement with GCMC analysis.
  </p>
  <p>
   Considering the largest changes observed on C2H2 uptake and binding energy before and after amino functionalization, we carried out in situ infrared (IR) spectroscopy measurements of C2H2 adsorption in both UiO-67 and UiO-67-(NH2)2(Figure 3e,f). When C2H2 gas was loaded into the activated UiO-67-(NH2)2, the IR absorption peaks at 3307-3268 cm-1, assigned to the νas(C2H2) bands, gradually increased and the absorption intensity reached 1.0 during the period of 16 min. Such multiple distinct νas(C2H2) bands imply that the C2H2 molecule may have multiple binding environments and interactions with the framework. (28) The obvious IR adsorption changes were also observed at the region of 1450-1250 cm-1. The νs(COO-) mode of the carboxylates in bare UiO-67-(NH2)2 are found at 1426 and 1408 cm-1, (29) and the v(C-N) vibration of -NH2 groups were registered as weak bands at 1385 and 1274 cm-1 (Figures 3e and S28). (30) After C2H2 loading, two new νs(COO-) bands appear at 1356 and 1305 cm-1, suggesting that the adsorbed C2H2 molecule would have interactions with the carboxylates. The v(C-N) bands were also found to gradually increase with the C2H2 loading, probably induced by the interactions between C2H2 and -NH2 groups. These IR results confirm that the carboxylates and -NH2 groups provide binding sites to interact with the C2H2 molecule. In comparison, while the similar variations on νas(C2H2) and νs(COO-) bands were also observed in UiO-67, the absorption intensity is extremely lower than that in UiO-67-(NH2)2 (Figure 3f). Higher relative intensity further suggests that the stronger C2H2 binding sites are populated in UiO-67-(NH2)2. In addition, the v(C-N) bands were not observed in UiO-67 due to the absence of -NH2 groups. All these IR observations can support the theoretical calculation results qualitatively.

   Dynamic column breakthrough experiments were performed in a packed column filled with activated UiO-67 or UiO-67-(NH2)2 to first evaluate their separation performance for binary C2H6/C2H4 (50/50) and C2H2/C2H4 (1/99) mixtures with a total flow of 1.25 mL min-1 at 298 K. As shown in Figure S29, efficient separation of C2H6 from the C2H6/C2H4 mixture can be realized in UiO-67, with a moderately pure C2H4 productivity of 0.21 mmol g-1 at the outlet. However, UiO-67 was not able to efficiently remove trace C2H2 from the 1/99 C2H2/C2H4 mixture with a negligible C2H4 productivity of 0.05 mmol g-1 due to its too close adsorption and ultralow selectivity on C2H2/C2H4 (Figure 4a). After the amino-functionalization, UiO-67-(NH2)2 exhibits the notably enhanced C2H2 and C2H6 uptakes and selectivities over C2H4. As shown in Figure 4c, highly efficient separation of C2H6 from the C2H6/C2H4 mixture can be achieved by UiO-67-(NH2)2 with a 2.67 times increase on C2H4 productivity (0.56 mmol g-1) than UiO-67. Most remarkably, UiO-67-(NH2)2 exhibits a notably improved separation capacity for the C2H2/C2H4 mixture (Figure 4d), wherein C2H4 gas first eluted through the adsorption bed at 51 min, while C2H2 breakthrough did not occur until 76 min. Pure C2H4 production at the outlet for a given cycle reaches 1.87 mmol g-1, which is nearly 40 times higher than that of UiO-67 and even comparable to some top-performing materials such as UTSA-100a (1.13 mmol g-1) (22a) and SIFSIX-3-Zn (1.94 mmol g-1).

   Next, we examined the separation performance of UiO-67 and UiO-67-(NH2)2 for actual C2H2/C2H6/C2H4 (1/49.5/49.5) mixture at the same conditions. Because of the ultralow C2H2/C2H4 separation performance, UiO-67 cannot simultaneously remove both C2H2 and C2H6 from the 1/49.5/49.5 ternary mixture to produce polymer-grade C2H4 in the effluent stream (Figure 4b). In contrast, Figure 4e reveals that complete separation of both C2H6 and C2H2 from 3-component C2H2/C2H6/C2H4 mixture can be fulfilled by UiO-67-(NH2)2. It was observed that C2H4 was first eluted at 59 min to yield a pure gas with an undetectable amount of C2H6 and C2H2 (the detection limit of the instrument is 0.01%). After that, C2H6 gas second passed through the adsorption bed at 68 min, and the adsorbent retained C2H2 last until 75 min. During the period between C2H4 and C2H6/C2H2 breakthrough, pure C2H4 productivity of UiO-67-(NH2)2 from the outlet effluent for a given cycle was calculated up to 0.55 mmol g-1, indicating its exceptional performance for one-step C2H4 purification from this ternary mixture. Further, multiple mixed-gas (C2H2/C2H6/C2H4 at 1/49.5/49.5) column breakthrough tests reveal that the separation performance of UiO-67-(NH2)2 can be preserved at least five continuous cycles (Figure S30), confirming its good recyclability for this separation.

   Given that an industrial application is potentially under high pressure (typically 5-10 bar), (23a) as required by pressure-swing adsorption (PSA) processes, we thus investigated the separation performance of UiO-67-(NH2)2 at 5 bar. As shown in Figure S31, the C2H6 and C2H4 adsorption isotherms were measured at 296 K up to 5 bar, and UiO-67-(NH2)2 still exhibits preferential binding of C2H6 over C2H4 with the significantly enhanced C2H6 uptake of 7.75 mmol g-1. According to IAST calculations for 50/50 C2H6/C2H4 mixtures, we found that UiO-67-(NH2)2 can maintain its selectivity to around 1.7 at 5 bar. Furthermore, dynamic column breakthrough curves clearly demonstrated that UiO-67-(NH2)2 is capable of simultaneously removing C2H2 and C2H6 from a 1/49.5/49.5 C2H2/C2H6/C2H4 mixture at 5 bar and 298 K (Figure S32). At this high pressure, the production of high-purity C2H4 from the outlet effluent can be further improved to 0.58 mmol g-1.

   The feed gases in the industrial production of high-purity C2H4 typically contain a small amount of water and acidic gases. These extreme separation conditions require separating materials with extremely high and long-term water and pH stabilities. We thus examined the chemical stability of UiO-67-(NH2)2 toward water, acid, and base solutions. The as-synthesized UiO-67-(NH2)2 samples were immersed in different chemical environments for 3 days, including water, HCl (pH 2), and NaOH (pH 12) aqueous solutions. As shown in Figure 4f, the PXRD measurements reveal that the framework of UiO-67-(NH2)2 can retain its structural integrity with no phase change and loss of crystallinity observed. Moreover, N2 adsorption isotherms at 77 K (Figure S33) and C2H2/C2H6 uptake capacities at 296 K (Figures 4f and S34) after the above treatments are very close to those of the pristine samples, further confirming its ultrahigh chemical stability. We also carried out six cycles of dynamic column breakthrough experiments on a wet C2H2/C2H6/C2H4 (1/49.5/49.5) mixture with 60% humidity to investigate the effect of moisture on separation performance. As shown in Figures S35 and S36, the almost unchanged breakthrough curves of UiO-67-(NH2)2 on the wet mixture confirm that the presence of water vapor has no effect on the separation capacity, rendering it an ideal adsorbent for one-step C2H4 purification under industrial conditions.

   Conclusion
  </h2>
  <p>
   In summary, we have proposed and demonstrated a new strategy of introducing Lewis basic sites into stable C2H6-selective MOFs for targeting highly efficient one-step C2H4 purification from C2H2/C2H6/C2H4 mixtures. Our foregoing results revealed that the immobilization of -NH2 groups into UiO-67 can construct suitable pore confinement associated with additional binding sites to dually strengthen both C2H2 and C2H6 binding affinity over that of C2H4, as revealed by the structural analysis and theoretical calculations. The amino-functionalized UiO-67-(NH2)2 thus exhibits not only the exceptionally high C2H2 and C2H6 uptakes but also the benchmark selectivities toward both C2H2/C2H4 and C2H6/C2H4 separations, outperforming all of the C2H2/C2H6-selective MOFs reported so far. Breakthrough experiments demonstrated that UiO-67-(NH2)2 can concurrently remove C2H2 and C2H6 from ternary C2 mixtures under dry and humid conditions, producing polymer-grade C2H4 in one-step with a high productivity of 0.55 mmol g-1. At a fundamental level, this work may provide a new avenue to design and functionalize porous MOFs with Lewis basic sites for targeting highly efficient one-step separation of C2H4 from C2H2/C2H6/C2H4 mixtures.
