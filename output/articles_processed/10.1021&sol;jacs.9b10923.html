   Abstract
  </h2>
  <p>
   High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideMetal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with open metal sites (OMSs) have been shown to preferentially adsorb unsaturated hydrocarbons such as C2H4 due to the formation of π-complexation. However, the adsorption capacity and selectivity might well be dampened under humid conditions because OMSs could be easily poisoned in the presence of water vapor. C2H6-selective adsorbents with less hydrophilic environments, on the other hand, not only could effectively minimize the impact of humidity on separation capacity but also could directly produce high-purity C2H4 from C2H6/C2H4 mixtures. Here, we report a C2H6-selective MOF (JNU-2) underlying a rare xae topology. Its cage-like cavities are interconnected through apertures with a limiting diameter of ca. 3.7 Å, which is in the domain of kinetic diameters of C2H4 and C2H6 molecules. Molecular modeling studies suggest the four oxygen atoms on aperture are poised to preferentially interact with C2H6 through multiple C-H O hydrogen bonding, rendering JNU-2 an enhanced C2H6 selectivity. Indeed, experimental results reveal that JNU-2 not only takes up a great amount of C2H6 comparable to other top-performing C2H6-selective MOFs but also displays excellent separation capacity even under humid conditions; moreover, it can be easily regenerated at room temperature owing to its moderate adsorption enthalpy. This work successfully demonstrated a strategy of balancing adsorption capacity and selectivity for C2H6 by designing MOF materials with cavities interconnected through tailored apertures. The apertures function as screening sites for C2H6 selectivity, while the internal cavities provide space for large adsorption.

   Introduction
  </h2>
  <p>
   Ethylene (C2H4) is the largest feedstock in petrochemical industries. The worldwide production of C2H4 (over 150 million tons in 2016) exceeds any other organic compound primarily because of its use in the manufacture of polyethylene. (1,2) Steam cracking is the principal industrial method for producing light alkenes, including C2H4. (3-5) However, this method alone does not yield high-purity C2H4 ( ≥ 99.95%, polymer grade), in which ethane (C2H6) is usually one of the major contaminants. Further purification, such as cryogenic distillation, is required to produce commercial polymer-grade C2H4, (6) but this process is extremely energy intensive as it necessitates the use of large distillation columns with 120-180 trays for high reflux ratios due to their similar molecular size and volatility. (7,8)
  </p>
  <p>
   Among the potential alternatives to replace cryogenic distillation for hydrocarbon separation, selective adsorption is one of the most desired technologies because of low energy consumption. (9,10) A variety of microporous adsorbents have been examined for the separation of light hydrocarbons, and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are one of the most promising candidates due to their large accessible surface areas, tunable pore sizes, and chemistries. (11-17) In particular, MOFs with open metal sites (OMSs) have been extensively studied because they preferentially interact with unsaturated hydrocarbons through metal π-complexation and thus separate them from their saturated counterparts. (18-20) For example, the material Fe2(dobdc) exhibited excellent performance in hydrocarbon separation with a superior selectivity for C2H4 over C2H6 thanks to the high-density OMSs engaging in side-on coordination of C2H4. The adsorption enthalpies for C2H4 and C2H6 were calculated to be -45 and -25 kJ/mol, respectively, and the coordinatively unsaturated FeII ions were determined as the strongest adsorption sites in the material by neutron powder diffraction analysis. (21) Nevertheless, the OMSs in MOFs could be easily poisoned in the presence of water vapor during the hydrocarbon separation owing to the much higher binding energy of water molecule to metal cations. Interestingly, prepared via the addition of O2 to FeII in Fe2(dobdc), the material Fe2(O2)(dobdc) showed an inversion of C2H6/C2H4 selectivity with a surprisingly large adsorption enthalpy of -67 kJ/mol for C2H6, leading to an unprecedented C2H6/C2H4 selectivity of 4.4 for a 1:1 mixture at 298 K and 1 bar. Neutron powder diffraction data indicated that the introduced Fe-peroxo sites engage in close contacts with one of the CH3 groups of the adsorbed C2H6 molecules. However, its performance under humid conditions was not discussed, which we suspect would be discouraging as both Fe2(dobdc) and Fe2(O2)(dobdc) are air sensitive and need to be handled in a drybox under an N2 atmosphere. (22)
  </p>
  <p>
   Aside from OMSs, molecular sieving appears to be another straightforward design of MOF materials for hydrocarbon separation. Such size-exclusion mechanism can be applied to the separation of C2H4/C2H6 mixture as the former is relatively small in molecular size. For example, the ultramicroporous MOF [Ca(C4O4)(H2O)], possessing rigid one-dimensional channels with an aperture size similar to C2H4 but smaller than a C2H6 molecule, was shown to function as a molecular sieve, preventing the transport of C2H6 molecules inside the channels. (23) Nevertheless, molecular sieving of C2H4 from C2H6 is less than ideal in terms of energy efficiency because further desorption is necessary in order to get C2H4. In addition, the C2H6 residing in the mobile phase (in between adsorbent particles) may contaminate the final C2H4 product during the desorption stage. (24) By this token, C2H6-selective adsorbents would be more energy efficient by directly producing high-purity C2H4.
  </p>
  <p>
   Molecular docking, a process of placing a preferred guest molecule in a receptor's binding site in biology, can also be applied in designing MOF materials for hydrocarbon separation, which would preferentially adsorb guest molecules of particular size and shape, not necessarily the smaller ones. Thus, the C2H6/C2H4 adsorption selectivity in favor of C2H4 could be reversed by precisely tuning the pore structure to better complement C2H6 instead of a C2H4 molecule. For example, the material MAF-49 exhibited a large C2H6 adsorption enthalpy of -60 kJ/mol at low coverage. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction and computational simulation studies showed that the primary adsorption site could accommodate either C2H4 or C2H6, and the exceptional C2H6 selectivity derives from the proper positioning of multiple electronegative functional groups on the ultramicroporous pore surface, which results in more C-H N hydrogen bonds with C2H6 than C2H4. In other words, the larger C2H6 molecules engage in stronger host-guest interactions with MAF-49. (25)
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite the excellent ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) selectivity ( ~ 9) in favor of C2H6 for an equimolar C2H6/C2H4 mixture at 316 K and 1 bar, MAF-49 exhibits a relatively low capacity for C2H6 (1.7 mmol/g) under the same conditions. The construction of a single-molecular pocket for accommodating one molecule at a time could compromise the surface area and potentially limit the overall uptake. Adequate adsorption capacity is nonetheless desired for adsorbents to be economically viable; therefore, an ideal adsorbent should exhibit both high adsorption capacity and selectivity. Unfortunately, these two key parameters are often trade-off to each other and appear to be difficult to improve simultaneously. To balance between selectivity (host-guest interaction) and capacity (surface area), a possible solution would be to design MOF materials featuring large cavities interconnected through tailored apertures; the apertures function as screening sites for desired gas molecules to go through, while the internal cavities provide a surface for large adsorption.
  </p>
  <p>
   To date, not many C2H6-selective MOFs have been identified, (22,23,26-35) and only a handful of them show favorable adsorption capacity for C2H6 ( > 3 mmol/g at 1 bar and 298 K), (22,23,33-35) let alone MOFs that are capable of separating C2H6 from C2H6/C2H4 gas mixtures under humid conditions. Herein, we report the successful construction of a multicomponent microporous MOF (JNU-2, JNU = Jinan University) underlying a rare xae topology. It possesses three cage-like cavities interconnected by apertures. In particular, the one connecting two smaller cavities bears a channel-limiting diameter (36) of ca. 3.7 Å, which is in the domain of the kinetic diameter of C2H4 and C2H6 molecules. Molecular modeling studies suggest the rich electronegativity on the aperture may facilitate a stronger interaction with C2H6 than C2H4 and function as a screening site for preferentially taking in C2H6 during the C2H6/C2H4 separation. Indeed, breakthrough experiments reveal that JNU-2 is capable of effectively separating C2H6 from C2H6/C2H4 gas mixtures of different ratios and demonstrating excellent separation capacity even under humid conditions. Together with its acid/base tolerance and room-temperature regeneration, JNU-2 is potentially an ideal adsorbent for C2H4 purification under real industrial conditions.

   Materials and Physical Measurements
  </h2>
  <p>
   All reagents and materials were obtained commercially and used as received without further purification. Zn(NO3)2 6H2O, Cu(NO3)2 3H2O, adenine, and 4-pyrazolecarboxylic acid were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. Ultrahigh-purity-grade ( > 99.999%) N2, Ar, C2H6, and C2H4 gases were used for adsorption-related measurements. Thermogravimetric analyses were performed under a N2 atmosphere with a temperature increasing rate of 10 °C min-1 on a TA-Q50 system. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data were collected on a Rigaku Ultima IV diffractometer (40 kV, 40 mA, Cu Kα1, 2 λ = 1.5418 Å) from 5° to 30° with a step size of 0.02° at a scan speed of 10°/min, and it was reduced to 2°/min for temperature-dependent PXRD measurements.

   Scale-up Synthesis of JNU-2
  </h2>
  <p>
   A mixture of Cu(NO3)2 3H2O (0.264 g, 1.08 mmol), Zn(NO3)2 6H2O (1.069 g, 3.6 mmol), adenine (0.162 g, 1.2 mmol), 4-pyrazolecarboxylic acid (0.264 g, 2.35 mmol), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 6 mL), N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA, 6 mL), and H2O (2 mL) was placed in a 50 mL glass vial and heated at 120 °C for 72 h. After it was cooled to room temperature at a rate of 5 °C h-1, the pale yellow block crystals (as-synthesized JNU-2) were collected and washed with DMF and methanol three times each, air dried, and heated under high vacuum at 200 °C for 24 h to afford desolvated JNU-2 ( ~ 700 mg, ~40% yield). Anal. Calcd (found) for C13H8CuN9O4Zn2 14H2O: C, 19.50 (19.41); H, 4.49 (3.95); N, 15.74 (15.62).

   Single-Crystal X-ray Diffraction Structure Analysis
  </h2>
  <p>
   Single-crystal diffraction data of as-synthesized and desolvated JNU-2 were collected at room temperature and at 100 K, respectively, via an Oxford Cryo stream system on a XtaLAB PRO MM007-DW diffractometer system equipped with a RA-Micro7HF-MR-DW(Cu/Mo) X-ray generator and HyPix-6000HE Hybrid Photon Counting (HPC) X-ray detector (Rigaku, Japan, Cu Kα, 2 λ = 1.54178 Å). The structures were solved and refined using Olex 2 with 'XS' and 'XL' plug-ins.

  <h2>
   Dynamic Column Breakthrough Experiments
  </h2>
  <p>
   Column breakthrough experiments were conducted on an in-house lab-scale fixed-bed system. The desolvated JNU-2 sample (ca. 2.4 g) was packed into a custom-made stainless steel column (3.15 mm i.d. × 450 mm) with silica wool filling the void space. It was heated in situ at 100 °C and high vacuum for 24 h before a helium flow was introduced to purge the adsorbent. Then a gas mixture of C2H6/C2H4 was allowed to flow into the column. Outlet effluent from the column was continuously monitored using gas chromatography (GC-7890B, Agilent) with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). After the breakthrough experiment, the sample was regenerated in situ under high vacuum for 6 h at room temperature before the next measurement.

   Results and Discussion
  </h2>
  <p>
   Solvothermal reaction of two base-metal salts, Cu(NO3)2 and Zn(NO3)2, and two simple organic compounds, 4-pyrazolecarboxylic acid (H2PyC) and adenine (Ad), in a mixed DMF/DMA/H2O solution at 120 °C for 3 days yielded crystals of as-synthesized JNU-2 (Figure S1), which was solvent exchanged and then high-temperature activated to afford desolvated JNU-2. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction revealed that desolvated JNU-2 is indeed a quaternary MOF (two clusters and two linkers), and it crystallizes in cubic space group Fm3c with a = b = c = 43.55 Å (Table S1). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of both the as-synthesized and the desolvated JNU-2 exhibited only intense sharp Cu(I) 2p3/2 peaks at 933.1 eV without satellite peaks characteristic of Cu(II), implying that the Cu ions are monovalent (Figure S2). Two CuI ions are bridged by two Ad ligands at N-3 and N-9 to form a planar Cu2(Ad)2 unit, and two of them are criss-crossed into a dimeric Cu4(Ad)4 cluster; while in the second cluster two ZnII ions are bridged by two PyC ligands at the two pyrazole nitrogen atoms, both of which further complete tetrahedral coordination by individually bonding to an Ad ligand of Cu4(Ad)4 cluster at N-7 and to a PyC ligand of neighboring dizinc cluster at one of its carboxylate oxygen (Figures S3 and S4). Thus, the network can be broken down to Cu4(Ad)4 and Zn2(NN-PyC)2(η1-COO)2(η1-Ad)2 clusters as secondary building units (SBUs) linked by PyC and Ad ligands (Figures 1a and S4). The Cu4(Ad)4 SBU is composed of two symmetry-dependent Cu2(Ad)2 units in which the two central Cu2N4 rings are in close contact. The distance from centroid to centroid of the two Cu2N4 rings is about 3.45 Å, indicating strong cuprophilic interactions within the dimeric Cu4(Ad)4 SBU (Figure S5a). Indeed, the interdimer interaction energy (ΔE) of the two Cu2(Ad)2 units was calculated to be -92.80 kJ mol-1 (Figure S5b). From the topological point of view, Cu4(Ad)4 acts as a 4-connected node and Zn2(NN-PyC)2(η1-COO)2(η1-Ad)2 acts as a 5-connected node; thus, the framework can be simplified as a binodal (4,5)-connected net with a rare xae topology (Figures 1c, S6, and S7). Three different cages can be visualized in this framework (Figure 1b). The small cage (cage A, 4.2 Å) and the large cage (cage C, 9.2 Å) are built with both SBUs as the vertices and both ligands as the edges, while the middle cage (cage B, 7.2 Å) is assembled only with the Zn2(NN-PyC)2(η1-COO)2(η1-Ad)2 SBU and PyC ligand. In a static view, the framework underlies three-dimensional (3D) dumbbell-shaped channels and the point interconnecting cage A and cage B is of ~3.7 Å in diameter (Figures 1d and S8-S10).

   The phase purity of bulk JNU-2 was determined by comparison between the simulated and the experimental powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns (Figure S11). Thermogravimetry and in situ variable-temperature PXRD experiments demonstrated that JNU-2 decomposes at above 400 °C under nitrogen atmosphere (Figure S12). The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping in conjunction with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) indicated the uniform distribution of Zn and Cu elements (Figure S13). To investigate the porosity of JNU-2, the as-synthesized JNU-2 crystals were washed with DMF and methanol followed by activation at 200 °C in vacuo. Ar and N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of desolvated JNU-2 were measured at 87 and 77 K, respectively (Figures 2a, S14, and S15), and both of them showed a fully reversible type-I behavior. A Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of 1219 m2 g-1 and a pore volume of 0.56 cm3 g-1 were calculated by using the ASAP 2020 physisorption analyzer's built-in software. The total pore volume of JNU-2 is nearly identical to the theoretical value of 0.54 cm3 g-1 (calculated from the crystal structure). The pore-size distribution (PSD) of JNU-2 derived from the adsorption branch of the Ar isotherm at 87 K according to the Horvath-Kawazoe model (pore geometry: slit) reveals three ultramicrospores with peaks centered at 3.4, 4.6, and 6.7 Å, corresponding to cage A, cage B, and cage C, respectively (Figures 2b and S7). From the crystal structure and electronic surface view, the aperture interconnecting cage A and cage B is rich with electronegative nitrogen and oxygen atoms, suggesting the possibility of binding light hydrocarbons, such as C2H6 and C2H4, through electrostatic interactions including C-H X hydrogen bonding (Figure S16).
  </p>
  <p>
   Thus, to explore gas adsorption and separation performance of JNU-2, we first measured the pure-component equilibrium adsorption isotherms for C2H6 and C2H4 at 273, 283, and 298 K under 1 bar (Figures 2c and S17-19). JNU-2 showed a large adsorption capacity for both C2H6 and C2H4 likely due to its high porosity as well as high density of electronegative nitrogen and oxygen atoms on the surface. More interestingly, the higher uptake of C2H6 than C2H4 indicates a C2H6-selective behavior in JNU-2. Its C2H6 uptake reaches 92.0 cm3 g-1 (4.19 mmol g-1) at 298 K and 1 bar, higher than most of the benchmark C2H6-selective adsorbents that have been studied for C2H6/C2H4 separation, such as Fe2(O2)(dobdc) (3.32 mmol g-1), TJT-100 (3.84 mmol g-1), Cu(Qc)2 (1.85 mmol g-1), ZIF-7 (1.85 mmol g-1), and MAF-49 (1.73 mmol g-1), comparable to MUF-15 (4.69 mmol g-1) under similar conditions (Table S7). Further, the adsorptions of both C2H6 and C2H4 are completely reversible, as evidenced by the continuous gas sorption measurements of JNU-2 at 298 K. The fully reproducible adsorption/desorption cycles indicate no oligomerization of C2H4 blocking the channels and no high temperature required for complete regeneration, possible downsides for MOFs with OMSs or extremely strong adsorption sites (Figures S20 and S21).
  </p>
  <p>
   The coverage-dependent adsorption enthalpy (Qst), a quantitative measurement of the binding affinity, was calculated by fitting adsorption isotherms at different temperatures into the virial equation. As shown in Figure 2d, the Qst value for C2H6 (-29.4 kJ mol-1) is slightly higher than that for C2H4 (-26.7 kJ mol-1) at near-zero coverage, indicative of relatively stronger binding affinity of JNU-2 toward C2H6. At higher coverage, the adsorption enthalpy for C2H6 is maintained at -25 kJ mol-1, not much different from that for C2H4. The significantly small adsorption enthalpy for C2H6 compared to MAF-49 (-60 kJ/mol) (25) and Fe2(O2)(dobdc) (-67 kJ/mol) (22) confirms no particularly strong adsorption sites in JNU-2 for C2H6, which also justifies the complete regeneration at room temperature. Together with the "inversed" C2H6/C2H4 adsorption selectivity and high C2H6 uptake capacity, JNU-2 shows potential as a C2H6-selective adsorbent for C2H6/C2H4 separation.
  </p>
  <p>
   Prompted by the suitable size and electrostatic potential of the channel-limiting aperture, we decided to take a closer look at its possible contribution in the C2H6/C2H4 selectivity. Time-dependent kinetic adsorption isotherms were measured for C2H6 and C2H4 at 298 K and up to 0.5 bar (Figure 3a). A notable difference between C2H6 and C2H4 adsorption kinetics is observed, and JNU-2 shows a faster uptake of C2H6. It is worth pointing out that instead of reaching maximum adsorption in a short period of time as in open-channel MOFs, (37) the adsorptions of both C2H6 and C2H4 in JNU-2 are slow but consistently increasing over time, indicating that these two gas molecules are not freely diffused into the JNU-2 channels, which is in good agreement with our channel-limiting assumption that the apertures might control the gas adsorption rate by taking in gas molecule one by one due to its comparable size to C2H6 and C2H4 molecules.
  </p>
  <p>
   To further understand the diffusion process in the dumbbell-shaped channels of JNU-2, in work reported here we have performed rigid interaction energy scanning along the z axis by using density functional theory (DFT) (Figure 3b and S30) and calculated the interaction potential energy of C2H6 or C2H4 adsorbed on JNU-2 as a function of the distance from the mass center of the gas molecule to the aperture center. As we expected, the interaction potential energy is dependent on the relative position of the gas molecule to the aperture pocket, and the energy reaches maximum (-32.3 kJ mol-1 for C2H6, -26.1 kJ mol-1 for C2H4) when passing through the aperture (Figures 3c, 3d, and S28). Such an energy difference ( > 6 kJ mol-1) at passing through the aperture seems large enough to generate appreciable selectivity of C2H6 over C2H4.
  </p>
  <p>
   To make a quantitative comparison of these host-guest interactions in JNU-2, we performed detailed structural analysis and energy decomposition analysis of the interaction energy between gas molecules and the channel model. In the optimized host-guest structures, the strongest interaction sites for both C2H6 and C2H4 is very close to the narrow apertures interconnecting cage A and cage B (Figures 4a, S8, and S28-29), and the calculated interaction energies (ΔE, ΔE = EMOF+gas - EMOF - Egas) at these sites are -32.3 and -26.1 kJ mol-1 for C2H6 and C2H4, respectively (Table S5), which are consistent with the experimental Qst values (-29.4 and -26.7 kJ mol-1 at near-zero coverage). As shown in Figure 4b, C2H6 forms four weak hydrogen bonds with JNU-2. In contrast, C2H4 only forms two weak hydrogen bonds. The difference in electrostatic interaction (7.7 kJ/mol, mainly hydrogen bonding) seems appropriate to reflect the overall host-guest interaction difference (6.2 kJ/mol) (Table S5). Although the interaction energy difference between C2H6 and C2H4 does not seem as significant as MAF-49 or Fe2(O2)(dobdc), we suspect a large number of such apertures along the dumbbell-shaped channels could function as multistage screening sites as gas molecules diffusing into the framework and gradually amplify the selectivity.
  </p>
  <p>
   The industrial production of polymer-grade C2H4 by steam cracking usually contains 6-10% of C2H6 as major byproduct and other impurities such as C2H2. (38) To evaluate the practical separation capacity of JNU-2, dynamic column breakthrough experiments were performed under dry condition, in which a C2H6/C2H4 mixture of 10/90 and C2H6/C2H4/C2H2 mixture of 10/87/3 were, respectively, introduced over a packed column of the activated JNU-2 sample (2.4 g) at rate of 2.0 mL min-1 (Figures 4d and S33). Breakthrough curves reveal that JNU-2 can efficiently realize complete separation of C2H6 and C2H2 from C2H4 under ambient conditions. As shown in Figure 4d and 4e, C2H4 first breaks through the column to yield an outflow of pure C2H4 (over 99.99%) with no detectable C2H6 or C2H2 (below the detection limit of thermal conductivity detector), whereas C2H6 is more preferentially adsorbed in JNU-2 and breaks through the column after a substantial time lapse (Figure S34). For practical industrial applications, the ideal separating materials should also have good recyclability. Thus, we implemented three dynamic breakthrough experiments for a C2H6/C2H4 mixture under similar operating conditions after being regenerated in vacuum at room temperature, and the results showed that there was no noticeable loss in the C2H6 separation capacity of JNU-2 (Figure 4d).
  </p>
  <p>
   The excellent breakthrough results encouraged us to further contrast JNU-2's separation performance with other C2H6-selective adsorbents. ZIF-8 is selected for its comparable adsorption selectivity and MUF-15 for its comparable adsorption capacity (Table S7). Breakthrough experiments were performed for a C2H6/C2H4 (50/50) mixture over a packed bed of ZIF-8, MUF-15, or JNU-2 at an inlet flow rate of 1.0 mL min-1 at 298 K (Figure 5a). C2H4 purity and productivity were estimated from their individually breakthrough curves (Figure 5a). As we can see, about 21.2 L of C2H4 with over 99.99% purity could be retrieved from a C2H6/C2H4 (50/50) mixture for 1 kg of JNU-2 (Figure S35 and Table S6), which is higher than most of the benchmark C2H6-selective adsorbents, such as MUF-15 (6.6 L/kg) and MAF-49 (6.2 L/kg), and comparable to the top-performing TJT-100 (16 L/kg) and Fe2(O2)(dobdc) (19.93 L/kg) (Table S7). Moreover, JNU-2 can easily recover its separation capacity after room-temperature regeneration as evidenced by the breakthrough cycling test (Figure 4e).
  </p>
  <p>
   Water vapor could have negative impacts on the uptake capacity and long-term stability of many physisorbents. (39-41) Large and consistent separation capacity upon exposure to water or water vapor is a prerequisite for porous materials to be viable in gas purification since moisture is inevitable in real industrial processes. JNU-2 exhibits excellent stability in water for at least 30 days in pH 2 or 12 aqueous solutions for over 15 days at room temperature, which is confirmed by the retained peaks and relative intensities in their corresponding PXRD patterns (Figure 6a) as well as the retained N2 adsorption isotherms (Figure 6b). JNU-2, therefore, is an ideal platform for studying the influence of humidity on gas separation by pre-excluding the possibility of framework decomposition. As shown in Figure 6c, the amount of water adsorbed in JNU-2 is very low prior to 20% RH (relative humidity), a water vapor uptake of only 0.069 g per gram of sorbent at 20% RH due to the lack of strong hydrophilic interactions. This could be highly convenient for C2H6/C2H4 separation under low-humidity conditions ( < 20% RH).To further simulate the practical applications of JNU-2 for C2H4 purification, dynamic column experiments were performed to test the material's ability to separate C2H6 from an equimolar C2H6/C2H4 mixture under ca. 10% RH conditions. Indeed, as shown in Figure 6d, C2H4 first breaks through the column, and then, C2H6 breaks through the column after a substantial time lapse. About 10.2 L of C2H4 with over 99.99% purity could be retrieved from a C2H6/C2H4 (50/50) mixture for 1 kg of JNU-2 (Figure S36). More importantly, the breakthrough experiments are fully reproducible upon room-temperature regeneration under vacuum, and three cycles of breakthrough curves are largely overlapped, indicating that JNU-2 could offer excellent separation capacity even under humid conditions and is viabile for C2H4 purification under real application conditions.

   We synthesized a multicomponent microporous MOF (JNU-2) underlying a rare xae topology; its cage-like cavities are interconnected through apertures with a limiting diameter of ~3.7 Å. The precise line up of O atoms on the aperture renders JNU-2 with an enhanced C2H6 selectivity over C2H4 by forming a couple of more C-H O hydrogen bonds with C2H6. Furthermore, the excellent water and pH stability of JNU-2 promise its potential applications under real conditions. Dynamic breakthrough experiments under humid conditions confirm JNU-2's exceptional capacity of separating C2H6 from C2H4, and its performance is not dramatically affected by the presence of water vapor due to its insignificant water uptake at low humidity. By illustrating a MOF material with large cavities interconnected with tailored apertures, this work successfully demonstrated a strategy for both high C2H6 adsorption capacity and high C2H6 over C2H4 selectivity through a multistage screening mechanism.
