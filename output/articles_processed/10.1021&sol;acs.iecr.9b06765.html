   High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideThe removal of ethane from ethene streams is of great importance and a challenging process for feedstock purification to produce polyethylene in the petrochemical industry. Traditional industrial cryogenic distillation is energy-intensive and expensive, while adsorptive separation technology using ethane selective adsorbents can effectively reduce this energy consumption. Herein, the direct functionalization of the open metal sites in a series of rare earth-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) [Ln-BTC (Ln(BTC)(H2O), Ln = Y, Sm, Eu, and Dy)] was achieved, which demonstrated highly efficient ethylene purification performance. A combination of single-component adsorption tests, ideal adsorption solution theory calculations, grand canonical Monte Carlo, and density-functional theory calculations showed that this series of MOFs selectively adsorbed ethane over ethylene. Therefore, these materials can be utilized as adsorbents for the efficient removal of low concentrations of ethane from an ethane/ethylene mixture to afford polymer-grade ethylene under ambient conditions.

  <h2>
   1. Introduction
  </h2>
  <p>
   The olefin industry is one of the main areas of the petrochemical industry and plays an important role. Among them, ethylene (C2H4) is a core component of the olefin industry, which affects all aspects of society. In 2018, global ethylene production exceeded 170 million tons. (1) In the current C2H4 production process, steam cracking and ethane dehydrogenation are the main production methods used. During the production of C2H4, it is inevitable that impurities such as ethane (C2H6) and acetylene are introduced. The largest proportion of downstream C2H4 products is polyethylene, which requires a C2H4 purity of >99.95%. Because C2H6 and C2H4 have similar boiling points and relative volatility, (2) the separation method used in the industry is cryogenic distillation with extremely high energy consumption. In 2016, the separation of olefin/alkanes was listed as one of the seven major separation processes used worldwide. (3) Therefore, the use of new separation methods to meet the current industrial needs, while reducing the energy consumption has become an urgent pursuit. (4)
  </p>
  <p>
   Pressure swing adsorption (PSA) or temperature swing adsorption (TSA) is a newly emerging separation technology, which uses an adsorbent as the main component and has been recently recognized as a simple and flexible process with the advantages of low cost, automation, and greatly reduced energy consumption. (5) By utilizing a suitable adsorbent (such as γ-Al2O3, zeolite, or porous carbon materials), PSA or TSA separation technology has been successfully used in the industrial separation of hydrogen and oxygen. While these traditional adsorbents always adsorb larger amounts of C2H4 than C2H6, they cannot meet the requirements for the production high purity C2H4. If C2H6 could be selectively removed, high purity C2H4 will be obtained via a one-step adsorption process. In the adsorptive separation of C2H6/C2H4, the use of a C2H6 selective adsorbent can reduce the energy consumption by ~40% when compared to a C2H4 selective adsorbent. (6,7) As porous materials that have rapidly developed over the past decade, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted a large amount of attention in gas separation and storage and catalysis. (8-22) Their customized porous structures have made them an ideal research platform for the fabrication of C2H6 selective adsorbents. Although many research groups have reported several C2H6 selective MOFs, (2,23-29) it is notable that these materials still suffer from low selectivity or low structural stability. To significantly reduce the C2H4 uptake and enhance the C2H6 binding affinity, functionalization of the open metal sites (OMSs) appears to be an effective strategy. (30) At present, the successful modification of the OMSs has only been realized with Fe2(dobdc) and Cr-BTC, (23,31) while both MOF materials need to remove the solvent first then introduce oxygen to bind the OMS, which is difficult for industrial-scale operation. Therefore, it would be very helpful to synthesize MOFs with "closed OMSs", in which the OMS was firmly bonded to a small molecule. Unfortunately, during the activation process of traditional MOFs, some of the bonded small molecules (normally H2O or CH3OH) can be easily removed with a solvent molecule in the porous channels.
  </p>
  <p>
   For this propose, MOFs constructed from rare earth elements were synthesized to investigate their C2H6/C2H4 separation performance in this work. These rare earth-based MOFs have a high coordination number and relatively strong interactions with the coordination molecules, and have been mainly used in fluorescence research. (32) Herein, we selected four Ln-BTC (Ln = Y, Sm, Eu, and Dy) MOFs for a detailed study, in which their coordinated H2O molecules are firmly bonded to the OMSs after the solvent removal process and thus, exhibit selective adsorption C2H6 behavior. Among them, Y-BTC exhibits the highest C2H6 adsorption capacity and C2H6/C2H4 adsorption selectivity. Breakthrough experiments further indicated that low concentrations of the C2H6 impurity could be efficiently separated from C2H6/C2H4 mixtures to produce polymer-grade C2H4 using a one-step adsorption process.

   2. Experimental Section
  </h2>
  <h2>
   2.1. Materials
  </h2>
  <p>
   All chemical and reagents were purchased from commercial suppliers and used without any further purification. Yttrium nitrate hexahydrate (Y(NO3) 6H2O, 99.9%), dysprosium nitrate hexahydrate (Dy(NO3) 6H2O, 99.9%), samarium nitrate hexahydrate (Sm(NO3) 6H2O, 99.9%), europium nitrate hexahydrate (Eu(NO3) 6H2O, 99.9%), and 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic (BTC, 99%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. N,N-Dimethylformamide (AR) and methanol (AR) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd.
  </p>
  <h2>
   2.2. Preparation of Ln-BTC (Ln = Y, Sm, Eu, and Dy)
  </h2>
  <p>
   The synthesis method was based on a literature procedure with a slight modification. (33-35) In a typical process, Y(NO3) 6H2O (1.915 g), BTC (1.00 g), dimethylformamide (DMF) (50 mL), and H2O (10 mL) were placed in a 100 mL Teflon-lined reactor and stirred for 30 min until the reactants were completely dissolved. The mixture was then placed in an air oven at 373 K for 12 h. After cooling, the product was washed three times with anhydrous DMF. The resulting product was formed as needle-like crystals. The product was immersed in acetone for 3 d and the solvent replaced every 12 h. The synthesis methods used for the other three Ln-BTCs were similar to that described for Y-BTC and by simply replacing the metal salt used.
  </p>
  <h2>
   2.3. Characterization
  </h2>
  <p>
   Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of the Ln-BTCs were collected on a Bruker D8 ADVANCE X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation. N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were recorded at 77 K on a Micromeritics ASAP 2460 instrument. All the materials were activated at 523 K for 5 h. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out on a NETZSCH STA 449F5 instrument. Under a nitrogen atmosphere, the samples were heated from 308 to 1073 K at a heating rate of 10 K/min. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed on a Hitachi SU8010 instrument to observe the morphology of the samples.
  </p>
  <h2>
   2.4. Adsorption Experiments
  </h2>
  <p>
   Single-component gas adsorption isotherms for C2H6 and C2H4 were recorded on an intelligent gravimetric analyzer (IGA 001, Hiden, UK) at 273 and 298 K. The solvent-exchanged sample was activated at 353 K under high vacuum (10-6) for 2 h until no weight loss was observed. High purity of C2H6 (99.99%) and C2H4 (99.99%) were used for the gas adsorption experiments.
  </p>
  <h2>
   2.5. Breakthrough Experiments
  </h2>
  <p>
   Breakthrough experiments were performed in an indoor built device. Approximately 0.9 g of the solvent exchanged sample was loaded into a stainless steel adsorption column with an inner diameter of 4 mm and length of 125 mm. Heated helium (353 K) was used as the purge gas and passed through the column at a flow rate of 100 mL/min for 12 h to completely remove the solvent. After activation, the column was cooled to 298 K and the ethane/ethylene mixtures (1:9 and 1:15, v/v) were introduced. The gas flow rate was controlled at 2 mL/min using a mass flow controller. Gas chromatography (TCD detector, GC-2014; Shimadzu) was used to monitor the composition of the eluted gas. After the breakthrough experiments, the samples were removed from the column, weighed, and checked using the PXRD.
  </p>
  <h2>
   2.6. Methods and Models in Simulation
  </h2>
  <p>
   In this part, grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to identify the co-adsorption of the C2H6/C2H4 gas mixture and binding sites in Y-BTC. GCMC simulations were employed using the sorption module with the COMPASS force field in Material Studio software. The MOFs were rigid with atoms frozen at their crystallographic positions during the GCMC simulations. The LJ interactions were calculated using a cutoff radius of 12.0 Å, while the coulombic interactions were handled using the Ewald summation method. For each state point, the GCMC simulation consists of 2.0 × 107 steps to guarantee equilibration. As for the DFT calculations, the Quantum-Espresso package was used in this work. A semi-empirical addition of the dispersive forces to conventional DFT was included in the calculation to account for the van der Waals interactions. The structure of Y-BTC was first optimized, the C2H4 or C2H6 gas molecules introduced to their potential locations in the MOF (based on the GCMC calculation), followed by full structural relaxation.

   3. Results and Discussion
  </h2>
  <h2>
   3.1. Characterization of Ln-BTC
  </h2>
  <p>
   Ln-BTC has isostructural structures, which can be illustrated using Y-BTC as an example (Figure 1a). The basic structural unit of Y-BTC consists of an Y3+ ion and six BTC ligands in which H2O molecules were bonded on the metal sites. The basic structural unit extends to construct a tetragonal porous framework along the c-axis.
  </p>
  <p>
   In this work, four Ln-BTCs were synthesized according to a literature procedure (32) and they all exhibit a cuboid shape (Figure S4). The PXRD patterns of the samples match well with the simulated patterns and the peaks were sharp, which showed that the synthesized samples had good purity and high crystallinity (Figure 1b). After acetone exchange and activation at 353 K under high vacuum, the free solvent molecules were removed from the porous channels and the frameworks maintained their position and strength in the PXRD patterns (Figure S2). During this process, the covalent water molecules were still bonded to the OMSs, as identified from the PXRD patterns and TGA curves (Figure S3). The corresponding loss of water molecules occurred at a higher temperature ( ~ 403 K), which was consistent with that previously reported. After the temperature increased to 723 K, the structures start to collapse, and thus exhibited a relatively high thermal stability. To further explore the porosity of the samples, we performed an N2-sorption experiment at 77 K. All four adsorption isotherms corresponded to a typical microporous structure (Figure S1) and the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas of the Ln-BTC (Ln = Y, Sm, Eu, and Dy) samples were calculated to be 933, 700, 720, and 947 m2/g, respectively.
  </p>
  <h2>
   3.2. C2H6 and C2H4 Single-Adsorption Isotherms of Ln-BTC
  </h2>
  <p>
   In order to study the separation ability of Ln-BTC for the removal of C2H6 from C2H4, single-component adsorption and kinetic adsorption for C2H6 and C2H4 were carried out (Figures S5 and S6). As expected, the C2H6 adsorption uptake of Ln-BTC was larger than that of C2H4 at 273 and 298 K (Figure 2), which indicated that the four MOFs had a stronger adsorption affinity toward C2H6. In addition, all of the isotherms were completely reversible and exhibit no hysteresis. Among the four MOFs studied, Y-BTC exhibited the highest C2H6 adsorption capacity (77.5 cm3/g at 298 K and 1 bar). From the single-component adsorption isotherms, it was observed that Y-BTC had the highest C2H6/C2H4 uptake ratio and C2H6 uptake, which indicated that it exhibited enhanced separation performance.
  </p>
  <h2>
   3.3. C2H6/C2H4 Adsorption Selectivity and Adsorption Heat of Ln-BTC
  </h2>
  <p>
   In order to evaluate the separation ability of Ln-BTC for C2H6/C2H4 mixtures and to compare their performance with other C2H6 selective materials, the gas adsorption selectivity was calculated using ideal adsorption solution theory (IAST). First, the dual site Langmuir-Freundlich model was used to fit the single-component adsorption curves obtained for C2H6 and C2H4 at 298 K using the following equation:where q is the adsorbed amount per mass of the adsorbent (mol/kg), qA,sat and qB,sat are the saturation capacities for adsorption at site A and site B, respectively, bA and bB are the constant for species i at adsorption site A and site B, respectively, p is the total pressure of the bulk gas at the equilibrium (kPa) and ν is the Freundlich exponent.
  </p>
  <p>
   The adsorption selectivity can be defined as followswhere qA and qB represent the molar loading within the MOFs and yA and yB represent the mole fraction in the gas mixture.
  </p>
  <p>
   The adsorption heat is often used to evaluate the adsorption affinity between the adsorbent and adsorbed gas. Herein, we calculated the adsorption heat for C2H6 and C2H4 on Ln-BTC using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation as followswhere Qst represents the adsorption heat (kJ/mol), R is a constant, T is the temperature, p represents pressure (kPa), and q represents the adsorption amount (mmol/g).
  </p>
  <p>
   Figure 3a,c shows the gas adsorption selectivity of Ln-BTC for C2H6/C2H4 mixtures (1/9 and 1/15 v/v) calculated from the single-component adsorption data at 298 K. Among them, Y-BTC, Sm-BTC, and Eu-BTC had a relatively similar selectivity of ~2. At 298 K and 1 bar, the selectivity of Y-BTC for the C2H6/C2H4 mixtures (1/9 and 1/15 v/v) was 1.92, which was the highest among the four MOFs studied (Figure S7). One possible reason is because the larger pore size of Y-BTC and higher van der Waals' force between C2H6 molecules will lead to an extra C2H6 adsorption. When compared with the values reported in the literature, it was higher than IRMOF-8, (36) PCN-245, (37) MIL-142A, and so forth. (38) In addition, the C2H6 and C2H4 adsorption heat calculated for the Ln-BTCs are given in Figure 3b,d. In the near-zero region, the C2H6 adsorption heat for the Ln-BTCs were all larger than that of C2H4, which reflected that all four MOFs were C2H6-selective adsorbents. For Y-BTC, its C2H6 and C2H4 adsorption heat in the near-zero region were 22 and 19 kJ/mol, respectively. The relatively low heat of adsorption facilitated the desorption of the adsorbent during the process, which further reduced the energy consumption.
  </p>
  <h2>
   3.4. GCMC and DFT Simulations
  </h2>
  <p>
   GCMC and DFT simulations were used to further study the thermodynamic affinities of C2H4 and C2H6 in Ln-BTC. The distribution of the adsorbed equimolar C2H4/C2H6 mixtures in Y-BTC was first investigated using the GCMC method. Figure 4 shows that the density of C2H6 was higher than that of C2H4 in the co-adsorption of C2H4/C2H6 on Y-BTC at 298 K and 1 bar, which is consistent with the adsorption behavior observed experimentally. In addition, DFT calculations were applied to determine the adsorption locations of the C2H6 and C2H4 molecules in Y-BTC. C2H6 and C2H4 molecules were introduced into the structure, individually and independently. After equilibrium, both molecules exhibited a binding affinity with the BTC ligands and C2H6 had a relatively short H O distance, which indicated its stronger interaction with the framework.
  </p>
  <h2>
   3.5. Breakthrough Experiments
  </h2>
  <p>
   From the above discussion, it can be seen that Y-BTC had the highest C2H6 adsorption capacity and C2H6/C2H4 selectivity. Therefore, we conducted a gas breakthrough test to further identify its actual separation effect on the C2H6/C2H4 mixtures (Figures S8 and S9). The feed gas (C2H6/C2H4 = 1:9 and 1:15 v/v) was introduced at a flow rate of 2 mL/min at 298 K and 1 bar. Figure 5a,b shows C2H4 was first eluted and C2H6 was subsequently passed through the column, which indicated that under the dynamic adsorption process for a mixed gas, Y-BTC also exhibited a stronger C2H6 adsorption affinity than that for C2H4. Moreover, their adsorption amount corresponds to the previous single-component adsorption test (Table S6). This ability enabled this MOF material to achieve the effective removal of low concentrations of C2H6 from gas mixtures to afford high purity C2H4 using a single breakthrough process.
  </p>
  <h2>
   3.6. Stability and Cycling Tests
  </h2>
  <p>
   In order to evaluate the reusability of Y-BTC, cycling tests for the single-component adsorption and breakthrough experiments were carried out. Figure 6a shows after five adsorption-desorption experiments and three continuous breakthrough cycles at 298 K and 1 bar, the adsorption and separation performance of Y-BTC was basically unchanged, indicating its good recycling ability. Moreover, PXRD and N2 sorption measurements demonstrated that the Y-BTC retained their structure and BET surface area over 2 days under low-humidity conditions (RH = 20%) (Figure S10).
  </p>
  <h2>
   4. Conclusions
  </h2>
  <p>
   In this work, we have applied the direct synthetic functionalization of the open metal sites in Ln-BTC (Ln = Y, Sm, Eu, and Dy) to prepare an efficient C2H6 adsorbent for C2H6/C2H4 separation. At 298 K and 1 bar, Y-BTC exhibited the highest C2H6 adsorption capacity (77.5 cm3/g) and C2H6/C2H4 selectivity (1.92) among the four Ln-BTC materials studied, as validated using single-component adsorption experiments. GCMC simulations and DFT calculations confirmed that the Y-BTC structure exhibited a higher binding affinity for C2H6 compared to C2H4. Based on this behavior, Y-BTC could efficiently remove low concentrations of C2H6 from C2H6/C2H4 mixtures to afford high purity C2H4 in the breakthrough experiments. Moreover, it featured high stability and cycling performance, making it a promising candidate for industrial implementation.
