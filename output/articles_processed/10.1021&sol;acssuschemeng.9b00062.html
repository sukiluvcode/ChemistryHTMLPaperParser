   High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideEngineering metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) for adsorptive ethylene/ethane separation has shown bright prospects for replacing the energy-intensive cryogenic distillation process. Herein, we demonstrate that pore size reduction in zirconium metal-organic frameworks (Zr-MOFs) can significantly improve their ethylene/ethane separation performance. Two Zr-MOFs based on the acetylenedicarboxylate ligand, UiO-66-ADC and NUS-36, are successfully synthesized. Different from UiO-66-ADC with an fcu topology, NUS-36 possesses a bcu network constructed from 8-connected Zr clusters and organic linkers, leading to ultramicropores smaller than 3.6 Å. NUS-36 selectively adsorbs C2H4 over C2H6 with a selectivity of 4.1 based on idea adsorbed solution theory (IAST) for an equimolar C2H4/C2H6 mixture at 298 K and 1 bar, contrasting the C2H6/C2H4 selectivity of 1.8 in UiO-66-ADC under the same conditions. The enhanced C2H4 affinity of NUS-36 is attributed to the synergistic enthalpic and entropic effects on gas sorption which are triggered by the congested pore environment. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of the pore size reduction strategy for the design and engineering of suitable MOFs for demanding gas separation processes.

   Introduction
  </h2>
  <p>
   Ethylene (C2H4), the raw material of a series of chemical products such as polyethylene, ethylene oxide, ethylene glycol, and ethylbenzene, has a cornerstone status in the petrochemical industry with an annual production of approximately 1.5 × 108 t. (1,2) The dominant technology to produce ethylene is steam cracking of naphtha and short alkanes (such as propane and ethane). This process generates gas streams containing ethylene and other gas components that need to be removed for the further utilization of ethylene. (2,3) One of these side products is ethane (C2H6) that has physical properties extremely close to those of ethylene. (4) The C2H4/C2H6 separation is hence very challenging and typically conducted by cryogenic distillation under low temperatures and high pressures, i.e.. at 183-258 K and 7-28 bar with distillation column tray numbers over 100. The energy consumption of C2H4/C2H6 separation along with the C3H6/C3H8 separation process constitutes 0.3% of global energy use, roughly equivalent to Singapore's annual energy consumpiton. (5)
  </p>
  <p>
   Adsorptive C2H4/C2H6 separation employing metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), coordination frameworks interconnected from inorganic clusters and organic multidentate ligands, has been proposed as a promising energy-efficient alternative to cryogenic distillation. (6,7) Compared to traditional adsorbents such as zeolites and porous carbons, MOFs feature better task-oriented structure tunability due to abundant choices of metals, ligands, framework topologies, and postsynthetic modification approaches. For instance, a proven strategy to design MOFs for C2H4/C2H6 separation is to judiciously select inorganic clusters with unsaturated metal centers (UMCs). Representative MOFs are the MOF-74 series and their polymorphs based on 4,6-dioxido-1,3-benzenedicarboxylate. (8-10) The one-dimensional (1D) channels of these MOFs are decorated with UMCs deficient of electrons. As a result, C2H4 with donatable π electrons can interact strongly with these sites while C2H6 cannot as its bonding electrons are all confined in the σ orbitals. (11) Another strategy is embodied in MIL-101-SO3Ag and NUS-6(Hf)-Ag, where transition metal cations such as Cu+ and Ag+ are anchored to the frameworks. (12-14) Due to the π-complexation between C2H4 and these cations, (15) the C2H4 affinities of these MOFs can be significantly enhanced compared to those of their unmodified precursors. The boosted C2H4 selectivity enabled by the aforementioned two strategies, however, is accompanied by heats of adsorption over 50 kJ mol-1 for C2H4 and steep rise of C2H4 uptake at low pressure, which are both unfavorable for adsorbent regeneration and continuous process operation. (16)
  </p>
  <p>
   Apart from the strategies discussed above, supramolecular interactions between MOFs and adsorbates, which are relatively weaker but strong enough to establish molecular recognition in MOFs, have been employed to perform C2H4/C2H6 separation. For instance, NOTT-300 can selectively adsorb C2H4 over C2H6 because C2H4 can form hydrogen bonds with the HO-Al moiety and π-π interactions with the phenyl rings. (17) Similarly, MAF-49 achieves an interesting C2H6 selectivity based on the unique hydrogen bonds between alkyl hydrogens and amino groups of the framework, which have greater strength and quantity than those formed between C2H4 and the framework. (18) Although these two MOFs can separate C2H4 and C2H6 with decent selectivity and sorption capacity, the rational design of specific supramolecular interactions in MOFs is still challenging.
  </p>
  <p>
   Recently, studies on gas separation in ultramicroporous MOFs such as hybrid ultramicroporous materials (HUMs) suggest that pore size reduction would be a promising direction to introduce supramolecular interactions in MOFs. (19,20) A classic example is the comparison between the C2H2 binding strengths in SIFSIX-2-Cu and SIFSIX-2-Cu-i. (21) Composed of identical building blocks, SIFSIX-2-Cu has a noninterpenetrated framework with a pore size around 13 Å, while SIFSIX-2-Cu-i has a 2-fold interpenetrated network with a smaller pore size of 5.15 Å. The contrast in pore sizes leads to the significant difference in binding strengths of C2H2 in these HUMs, because each C2H2 molecule can form two strong hydrogen bonds with two SiF62- pillars from two individual networks of SIFSIX-2-Cu-i, while the same molecule can only form one hydrogen bond with the adjacent SiF62- in SIFSIX-2-Cu. During the preparation of this manuscript, boosted C2H6 selectivity has been achieved in ultramicroporous MOFs. (22) Compared to Cu(ina)2 (Hina = isonicotinic acid), Cu(Qc)2 (HQc = quinoline-5-carboxylic acid) possesses the same sql topology but a smaller aperture size (4.1 Å vs 3.3 Å) due to the employment of a bulkier ligand. (23) The reduction in the pore size of Cu(Qc)2 results in enhanced van der Waals interactions and more C-H π bonds between C2H6 and the frameworks, which synergistically contribute to the elevated C2H6 selectivity in Cu(Qc)2. (22) In addition to establishing supramolecular interactions, constricted pores can introduce diffusion barriers in MOFs which could distinguish gases with different size in the confined pore structures. (24) For instance, the M-gallate series (M = Ni, Mg, Co) have been demonstrated to adsorb C2H4 but exclude C2H6 because the cross-sectional size of ethane is larger than the gating windows (3.47-3.69 Å) of the MOFs. (25) This molecular sieving behavior leads to high ideal C2H4/C2H6 selectivity (52) without compromising the C2H4 uptake capacity (3.37 mmol g-1 at 298 K, 1 bar). Similarly, molecular sieving C2H4 from C2H6 has been achieved in UTSA-280, an ultramicroporous MOF constructed from Ca2+ and rigid squarate linkers, because the aperture of the MOF channels sits between the smallest cross sections of C2H6 and C2H4. (26) It is noteworthy that UTSA-280 can be easily synthesized at the kilogram scale using water as solvent at room temperature, making it a promising adsorbent candidate for practical industrial implementation.
  </p>
  <p>
   Zr-MOFs are a series of MOFs composed of Zr-containing building units with excellent stability and may be massively produced using the modulated hydrothermal (MHT) synthesis method. (27,28) However, most of the reported Zr-MOFs demonstrate marginal performance for C2H4/C2H6 separation because of the lack of strong interactions and suitable pore size. (6) Herein, we report an ultramicroporous Zr-MOF NUS-36 with decent performance for C2H4/C2H6 separation. Constructed from Zr6 clusters and acetylenedicarboxylate (ADC), the bcu network of NUS-36 features distorted octahedral cages which are smaller than 3.6 Å and are inaccessible to N2 at 77 K. The ultramicroporous nature endows NUS-36 with interesting C2H4 sorption selectivity over C2H6, contrasting significantly with the C2H6-selective UiO-66-ADC (previously denoted as HHU-1) (29) which has similar compositions but with larger pores (Scheme 1). Our study indicates that pore size reduction can be an effective and feasible approach to improve the C2H4/C2H6 separation performance of MOFs.

  <p>
   All the reagents were obtained from commercial suppliers and used without further purification. Field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) analyses were conducted on an FEI Quanta 600 SEM (20 kV). Samples were treated via Pt sputtering before observation. Powder X-ray diffraction patterns were obtained on a Rigaku MiniFlex 600 X-ray powder diffractometer equipped with a Cu sealed tube (λ = 1.5418 Å) operating at 40 kV, 15 mA, with a scan rate of 0.05 deg s-1. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed using a Shimadzu DTG-60AH thermal analyzer under an air flow (30 mL min-1) with a heating rate of 10 °C min-1. Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) were obtained with a Bruker VERTEX 70. The porosity of the packed column for the breakthrough study was determined by a mercury intrusion porosimeter (Micromeritics Autopore III 9420). Liquid 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were collected with a Bruker AV400 NMR spectrometer (400 MHz). MOFs (20 mg) and ligands (10 mg) were digested in 3.5 M NaOH in D2O before NMR characterizations. N2 and O2 sorption isotherms at 77 K were measured using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 system, and sorption isotherms of ethylene, ethane, and vapors were measured using Quantachrome Autosorb iQ3 equipment. Before the measurements, the sample ( ~ 50 mg) was degassed under reduced pressure ( < 10-2 Pa) at 80 °C for 10 h.

   Breakthrough Experiments
  </h2>
  <p>
   The breakthrough experiments were conducted using a home-built set up shown in Scheme S1. The detailed experimental method can be found in our previous work. (14) A 7 cm stainless steel column (internal diameter: 0.46 cm) filled with MOF powders (ca. 1.2 g) was activated by purging a constant He flow (8 ± 0.1 standard cubic centimeter per minute, sccm) through the column at room temperature for 1 h, 60 °C for 1 h, 80 °C for 2 h, and 120 °C for 8 h until no solvent or moisture signal at the outlet could be detected by the mass spectrometer. For the breakthrough experiments, an equimolar mixture of C2H4 and C2H6 with a total flow rate of 1 ± 0.1 sccm was stabilized for 30 min before introducing it into the column. Methods to calculate gas coadsorption capacity and selectivity based on breakthrough experiments are detailed in the Supporting Information.

   Material Characterizations and Structure Determination

  <p>
   Since the initial report of the Zr-MOF UiO-66 in 2008, (30) the Zr-MOF family has developed steadily and prosperously. In addition to the classic Zr6O8 cluster found in UiO-66, new Zr-oxo building blocks such as Zr-oxo chains, Zr8O6, and Zr12O22 with various connectivity ranging from 12 to 4 have been reported. (31-35) Moreover, ligands with different size and degree of functionality have been continuously designed and synthesized, which along with the flexible configuration of Zr-clusters greatly expands the structural abundancy of Zr-MOFs. Nevertheless, scarce examples of Zr-MOFs possess ultramicropores, i.e.. pores smaller than 4 Å. (31,36,37)
  </p>
  <p>
   Acetylenedicarboxylic acid (H2ADC) was identified as a promising ligand for the preparation of ultramicroporous Zr-MOFs considering its relatively small size and the potential of further functionalization to increase the bulkiness of the ligand. Two phases of Zr-MOFs were successfully obtained by varying the synthetic solvents, modulators, and temperatures. Specifically, running an acetic-acid-modulated hydrothermal reaction at 85 °C (29) or a formic-acid-modulated solvothermal reaction at 120 °C yields a crystalline phase with the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) spectrum matching well with the simulated pattern of ADC-based UiO-66 analog (Figure 1a). This phase, denoted as UiO-66-ADC in this study, has a typical fcu topology composed of 12-connected Zr clusters and ADC linkers. The similarity between ADC and fumarate results in similar lattice parameters between UiO-66-ADC and MOF-801 and hence similar pore structures, (29) suggesting that these MOFs have comparable gas sorption properties (vide infra). Interestingly, reacting ADC with ZrOCl2 8H2O in the mixture of formic acid and water at 120 °C affords another crystalline phase, termed as NUS-36, which is different from typical Zr-MOFs with linear linkers such as UiO-66, MIL-140, and hxl-UiO-66 (Figure 1a, Figure S1). (33,38) To understand the composition of UiO-66-ADC and NUS-36, these MOFs were digested in NaOH/D2O and analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). As shown in Figure 1b, the digested UiO-66-ADC and NUS-36 exhibit no proton signals of ADC apart from those belonging to formate or acetate anions, suggesting that the linker transformation observed in the previous synthesis of HHU-2 did not occur during the synthesis of UiO-66-ADC or NUS-36. (29) This conclusion is further corroborated by the 13C NMR result (Figure 1c), where the signals of alkyne and carboxylate carbons of ADC can be unambiguously identified at 75.6 and 159.7 ppm, respectively. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) reveals that NUS-36 has similar functional groups to UiO-66-ADC (Figure S2a), and thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) indicate that NUS-36 and UiO-66-ADC have comparable thermal stabilities (Figure S2b).
  </p>
  <p>
   All the efforts in growing large single crystals of NUS-36 failed, so the crystal structure of NUS-36 was determined from PXRD data (Figure 2a, Table S1, Rietveld refinement details can be found in the Supporting Information). Rietveld refinement results indicate that NUS-36 crystallizes in the space group of P4n2 and shows a bcu framework interconnected by 8-connected Zr clusters and ADC linker. This topology is identical to that of Zr(3-methyladipate), (39) DUT-53, (40) and PCN-700 (Figure 2b,c). (41) The equatorial coordination sites of the Zr clusters are capped with formate anions as suggested by the NMR and TGA results. This framework can also be regarded as the stacking product of octahedral cages highlighted in Figure 2b and 2c by sharing their edges and vertices. As shown in Figure 2d, the pore aperture of NUS-36 is considerably smaller than that (4.4 Å) of UiO-66-ADC. (29) Moreover, the specific solvent-accessible volume of NUS-36 calculated by PLATON is only 0.12 cm3 g-1, about one-third of 0.35 cm3 g-1 for UiO-66-ADC. Such an ultramicroporosity observed in NUS-36 is rarely encountered in the MOFs based on group IV metals. (42)

   Porosity Characterizations
  </h2>
  <p>
   After the structural determination of NUS-36, it is desirable to determine how the structural difference between NUS-36 and UiO-66-ADC may affect their gas sorption properties. N2 sorption tests at 77 K indicate that UiO-66-ADC has a type I isotherm with a type IV adsorption-desorption hysteresis loop (Figure 3a). (43) Pore size distribution calculated by the nonlocal density functional theory (NLDFT) model and the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method reveals the coexistence of micropores (3.9, 5.4, and 11.8 Å) and mesopores (3.8 nm, Figure 3b and Figure S3a). The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of UiO-66-ADC is 556 m2 g-1, which is comparable to the recently reported value (551 m2 g-1 of HHU-1). (29) On the contrary, NUS-36 exhibits strikingly different N2 sorption behavior at 77 K even though it is constructed from the same ligand and Zr6 cluster as that of UiO-66-ADC (Figure 3a). The 77 K N2 sorption isotherm of NUS-36 follows a type II pattern which is typically observed in nonporous or macroporous (pore size larger than 50 nm) materials including some two-dimensional MOFs (44,45) and porous organic nanosheets (PONs). (46,47) The initial surge of N2 uptake at the low relative pressure range (P/P0 < 0.01) is missing in NUS-36, resulting in a significantly lower N2 uptake (6.1 cm3 g-1) than that of UiO-66-ADC (127 cm3 g-1) at P/P0 = 0.01. The subsequent linear increase in N2 uptake of NUS-36 at higher pressures can be attributed to surface adsorption. The calculated BET surface area of NUS-36 is 79.1 m2 g-1, 92% of which is contributed by surface adsorption according to the t-plot analysis (Figure S3b). Considering the N2 sorption result along with the FESEM images of NUS-36 which do not show any macropores on the crystal surface (Figure S4b), we speculated that the pore aperture of NUS-36 might be so small that N2 with a kinetic diameter of 3.64 Å cannot overcome the diffusion barrier to access the constricted internal pores under cryogenic conditions. Changing N2 to other gas probes with smaller kinetic diameters should result in higher gas uptakes in NUS-36, because smaller gas probes may have enough kinetic energy to overcome the relatively lower energy barriers for diffusion into the ultramicroporous structure.
  </p>
  <p>
   With this assumption in mind, O2 with a smaller size (3.46 Å) was selected to probe the internal texture of NUS-36 at 77 K (Figure 3a). Interestingly, an initial uplifting of O2 uptake at low pressures was observed with an O2 uptake of ca. 31 cm3 g-1 at P/P0 = 0.02, which is 340% higher than the N2 uptake under the same condition, suggesting that O2 can access the ultramicropores that are inaccessible to the bulkier N2. Moreover, the noticeable adsorption-desorption hysteresis of O2 indicates significant diffusion hindrance imposed on the O2 molecules. This is probably because the pore size of NUS-36 is comparable to the dimension of O2 such that the adsorbed O2 molecules can experience strong van der Waals interactions with the walls of NUS-36. The specific BET surface area of NUS-36 calculated on the basis of the O2 adsorption branch is 111.6 m2 g-1, which is 41% higher than that derived from the N2 isotherm. The discrepancy between the surface areas calculated from N2 and O2 sorption data confirms the existence of ultramicropores in NUS-36, which can distinguish O2 from N2 under cryogenic conditions. The BET surface area of NUS-36 calculated using 273 K CO2 sorption data is even higher (298 m2 g-1, Figure 3c), which can be rationalized by the fact that relatively smaller CO2 (3.3 Å) can assess greater internal pore area than O2. NLDFT calculation on the basis of the CO2 sorption data reveals a pore size of 3.49 Å (Figure 3b), which is among the smallest of all the reported porous Zr-MOFs. (31,36,37)
  </p>
  <p>
   Apart from interesting sorption properties of N2, O2, and CO2, the ultramicroporous nature of NUS-36 is also embodied in the size-selective sorption behavior of water (2.9 Å), (48) methanol (3.6 Å), (48) ethanol (4.3 Å), (49) and isopropanol (4.7 Å) (48) at 293 K as shown in Figure 3d. Similar to UiO-66-ADC (Figure S5), water sorption results indicate that NUS-36 is a hydrophilic material manifested by the type I(b) sorption isotherm. (29,43) This is unsurprising as the building blocks of NUS-36, i.e. ADC, Zr6 clusters, and terminal formate ligands are all hydrophilic. The pore volume of NUS-36 (0.12 cm3 g-1) derived from the water uptake at P/P0 = 0.09 (151 cm3 g-1) is about 60% of that of UiO-66-ADC, correlating well with their surface area difference. Interestingly, the methanol uptake of NUS-36 is significantly lower than that of water under the same testing condition. In addition, a huge hysteresis was observed in the methanol sorption isotherm, indicating the existence of diffusional hindrance for methanol. This is probably because methanol with a relatively larger molecular dimension cannot access the pore space of NUS-36 as freely as water. During desorption, methanol may experience stronger van der Waals interactions with the pore walls of NUS-36 due to size-matching, which resembles the O2 desorption hysteresis at 77 K. Such size confinement phenomena were also observed in the sorption of even larger alcohols in NUS-36 (i.e.. ethanol and isopropanol), where negligible uptake amounts of vapor were detected (ca. 11.1 cm3 g-1 and 6.2 cm3 g-1 at P/P0 = 0.09 for ethanol and isopropanol, respectively, Figure 3d). These vapor uptakes of NUS-36 are much lower than that of UiO-66-ADC (Figure S5), again demonstrating the pore size difference between these two MOFs.

   Ethylene/Ethane Separation Performance

  <p>
   Inspired by the ultramicroporous nature of NUS-36, we speculated that such a unique pore structure could be harnessed for olefin/paraffin separations as what has been achieved in KAUST-7 and Cu(Qc)2. (22,50) The C2H4 and C2H6 sorption properties of NUS-36 were studied and compared to those of UiO-66-ADC, which shares the same building blocks but features a different topology and porosity. As shown in Figure 4a, UiO-66-ADC exhibits very minor sorption selectivity favorable for C2H6 as indicated by the slightly steeper C2H6 adsorption isotherm at low pressures, which resembles the sorption isotherms of C2H4 and C2H6 in MOF-801 (Figure S6). Such a marginal C2H6 selectivity has been observed in other nonpolar MOFs without strong binding sites to C2H4, such as Ni(bdc)(ted)0.5, (51) PCN-250, (52) and PCN-245, (53) where the relatively stronger dispersive interaction between C2H6 and the frameworks determines the sorption selectivity. NUS-36, however, shows an opposite sorption selectivity. The C2H4 adsorption isotherm of NUS-36 is more convex than that of C2H6, and the gas uptakes at 298 K and 105.8 kPa are 1.46 mmol g-1 and 1.01 mmol g-1 for C2H4 and C2H6, respectively. Closer observation of the isotherms at pressures below 10 kPa reveals that the C2H4 uptakes in NUS-36 are comparable to or even slightly higher than those in UiO-66-ADC, while C2H6 uptakes in the former MOF are significantly lower than those in the latter. This interesting inverse gas selectivity suggests the critical role of the constricted pore environment of NUS-36 in boosting the C2H4 affinity while crippling the C2H6 interactions with NUS-36. Ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) was employed to calculate the ideal gas sorption selectivities (Figure 4b). For an equimolar C2H4/C2H6 mixture at 298 K and 100 kPa, the ideal C2H6 sorption selectivity of UiO-66-ADC and C2H4 selectivity of NUS-36 are 1.8 and 4.1, respectively. The C2H4 selectivity of NUS-36 is even comparable to some zeolites like Li-ETS-10 (5) (54) and zeolite 5A (4.5), (55) as well as MOFs with open metal sites such as HKUST-1 (3.6), Co-MOF-74 (6.5), and Mg-MOF-74 (5.6) (Table 1). (56) Such a C2H4 selectivity is rarely achieved in MOFs based on group IV metals.

   Gas sorption cycles were measured to evaluate the reusability of NUS-36. As shown in Figure 4c, no significant decline in gas uptake capacity was observed after 9 and 5 adsorption-desorption cycles for C2H4 and C2H6, respectively, indicating that the ultramicroporous feature does not compromise the facile regeneration of NUS-36. Breakthrough experiments of an equimolar C2H4/C2H6 mixture at 298 K and 1 bar further confirm the selective C2H4 sorption in NUS-36 (Figure 4d). The calculated coadsorption C2H4/C2H6 selectivity is 3.2, slightly lower than the ideal selectivity calculated by IAST, which neglects adsorbate-adsorbate interactions. (57) Cycling breakthrough experiments further show that the adsorption processes are reversible and NUS-36 can be regenerated by purging He through the column without external heating (Figure S7).

   Ethylene/Ethane Separation Mechanisms in NUS-36
  </h2>
  <p>
   The isosteric heat (Qst) and entropy change (ΔSads) of C2H4 and C2H6 sorption in NUS-36 and UiO-66-ADC were calculated on the basis of the gas sorption isotherms at 273, 298, and 313 K in order to understand the C2H4 selectivity of NUS-36 (Figure 5, Figure S8, and Figure S9). For the more porous UiO-66-ADC, the zero-coverage Qst of C2H4 and C2H6 are comparable to each other (36.0 kJ mol-1, Figure 5a), indicating their similar affinities to the UiO-66-ADC framework. At higher gas loadings, the Qst value of C2H6 evolves slightly greater than that of C2H4, correlating well with the greater IAST C2H6 selectivity of UiO-66-ADC. Likewise, the zero-coverage Qst of C2H4 (43.6 kJ mol-1) and C2H6 (43.8 kJ mol-1) in NUS-36 are comparable to each other. Nevertheless, these values are noticeably higher than those in UiO-66-ADC, suggesting that the C2 affinities in NUS-36 have been enhanced in the constricted pore environment without introducing any extra strong binding sites to the hydrocarbons. These Qst values are comparable to those of some MOFs with open metal sites such as HKUST-1 (39 kJ mol-1) (56) and MgMOF-74 (42 kJ mol-1) (9) but significantly lower than those of Ni2(m-dobdc) (55 kJ mol-1), (10) MIL-101-SO3Ag (120 kJ mol-1), (13) and NUS-6(Hf)-Ag (56.5 kJ mol-1). (14) These comparisons suggest that pore size reduction could be an alternative strategy to the introduction of UMCs for enhancing C2H4 affinity to MOFs without compromising considerable energy penalty. Interestingly, the difference between Qst for C2H4 and C2H6 can be as large as 22.3 kJ mol-1 at higher gas loadings. This greater C2H4 affinity in NUS-36 at high gas loading can be ascribed to the slimmer dimension of C2H4 that can maximize its packing efficiency at high loadings and consequently its van der Waals interactions with the framework. (58,59)
  </p>
  <p>
   Apart from Qst, the ΔSads can reveal the mechanism of selective gas sorption in NUS-36 from another perspective (Figure 5b). Distinguishable differences (17.8-22.5 J mol-1 K-1) between the ΔSads of the gas adsorption in NUS-36 can be observed over the pressure range investigated. Specifically, the ΔSads of C2H6 is higher than that of C2H4 for the same gas loading, suggesting that C2H6 loses more degree of freedom than C2H4 upon adsorption in this ultramicroporous MOF. This is possibly because the planar C2H4 with a smaller molecular dimension (4.84 × 4.18 × 3.28 Å (3)) can fit in the constricted pores of NUS-36 relatively easily without significantly changing its conformations in the gas state, while the bulkier dumbbell-like C2H6 (4.82 × 4.08 × 3.81 Å (3)) can only adopt limited conformations for adsorption in the narrow pores of NUS-36. Such different extents of conformation loss of C2H4 and C2H6, which are triggered by the confined pore environment, could be another driving force in addition to the aforementioned host-guest interactions. Similar entropy-driven selective gas sorption phenomena have been observed in the separation of xylene isomers in MAF-X8 (60) and entropic separation of hexane isomers using MFI, (59) but they have been rarely reported in the MOF-based separation of gases as small as C2H4 and C2H6. As for UiO-66-ADC, the divergences between ΔSads of the gases are much smaller than those observed in NUS-36, possibly because the pores of UiO-66-ADC are large enough to host both gases and hence the entropic effect is less significant. This entropy analysis and Qst calculation indicates that pore size reduction is pivotal in harnessing the advantage of efficient packing and less adsorption entropy penalty of C2H4 for realizing selective C2H4 adsorption in NUS-36.

   Conclusion
  </h2>
  <p>
   In summary, this study demonstrates that pore size reduction is a successful strategy to improve the C2H4/C2H6 separation performance of Zr-MOFs. The effectiveness of this strategy was justified by detailed investigations on the porosity and C2H4/C2H6 separation performance of two Zr-MOFs, UiO-66-ADC, and NUS-36, which share the same organic linker and Zr6 cluster but with different framework topologies. UiO-66-ADC exhibits a typical fcu topology with a surface area of 556 m2 g-1, whereas NUS-36 with a bcu topology shows little N2 uptake at 77 K and features ultramicropores smaller than 3.6 Å. The constricted pore environment endows NUS-36 with an IAST C2H4/C2H6 selectivity of 4.1, in contrast to the reversed C2H6/C2H4 selectivity of 1.8 in UiO-66-ADC. The enhanced C2H4 affinity of NUS-36 can be attributed to the synergistic contributions of stronger van der Waals interactions at high gas loadings and the lower adsorption entropy penalty of C2H4 in the congested pores of NUS-36. Although the C2H4/C2H6 separation performance of NUS-36 is not outstanding compared with the benchmark materials, our study highlights the significant impact of pore size engineering on the gas adsorption properties of MOFs, expanding the toolbox to design and engineer promising MOFs for the challenging gas separation processes.
