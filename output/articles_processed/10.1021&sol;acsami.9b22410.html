   Abstract

  <p>
   High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideAs a new type of porous material, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been widely studied in gas adsorption and separation, especially in C2 hydrocarbons. Considering the stronger interaction between the unsaturated molecules and the metal sites, and the smaller molecular size of unsaturated molecules, the usual relationship of affinities and adsorption capacities among C2 hydrocarbons in most common MOFs is C2H2 > C2H4 > C2H6. Herein, a unique microporous metal-organic framework, NUM-7a (activated NUM-7), with a completely reversed adsorption relationship for C2 hydrocarbons (C2H6 > C2H4 > C2H2) has been successfully synthesized, which breaks the traditional concept of the adsorption relationship of MOFs for C2 hydrocarbons. Based on this unique adsorption relationship, a green and simple one-step separation purification for a large amount of C2H4 can be expected to be achieved through the selective adsorption of C2H6. In addition, NUM-7a also shows good selectivities in C2H2/CO2 and CO2/CH4.

   Introduction
  </h2>
  <p>
   Separation and purification of C2 hydrocarbons are very valuable, the products of which are the most important cornerstone of industrial production. C2 hydrocarbon separation products that are regarded as the blood of the industry, with an annual output of hundreds of millions of tons, (1) are widely used in the further synthesis of various industrial products, which are ubiquitous in human life, such as fibers, plastics, rubber, and the likes. (2) Therefore, such high annual output is followed by an extremely high energy consumption problem, which is usually required to achieve high-temperature and high-pressure conditions for the separations of light hydrocarbons with exceptionally similar physical and chemical characteristics. (1) Nowadays, with the increasingly serious energy and environmental issues, energy conservation and emission reduction in all fields urgently need more attention. More efficient and energy-efficient separation methods need to be found to replace the traditional high-energy cryogenic rectification methods.
  </p>
  <p>
   Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), as a new type of remarkable porous material with extremely high surface area, structural tenability, linkers tailorability, and controllable properties, (3) have been widely used in pressure swing adsorption (PSA), which is an efficient separation method with simple operation, high product purity, and low energy consumption. (4) Especially in the separation of light hydrocarbons, MOFs are considered to be a kind of green separation material with great potential and bright prospects, which are widely studied by many researchers. (5-17) Up to now, many types of MOFs have been reported to have good performance in C2H4/C2H6 (5,6,9,18-20) and C2H2/C2H4 (5,7-9,13-15,21) separations. Typically, due to the stronger interaction between the unsaturated molecules and the metal sites, and the smaller molecule size of unsaturated molecules resulting in more molecules being captured by the framework, the usual relationship of affinities and adsorption capacities among C2 hydrocarbons in most common MOFs is C2H2 > C2H4 > C2H6. (5,6) In the separation of C2H4/C2H6 mixture, which accounts for the majority of C2 hydrocarbons separation with a great energy consumption, because of the interaction relationship of C2 hydrocarbons with frameworks, most MOFs selectively adsorb C2H4 and then obtain a purified C2H4 product by further desorption and subsequent series of steps. (1) As a result, the process of C2H4 purification and energy consumption still needs to be optimized. Fortunately, some MOFs with partially reversed adsorption characteristics (C2H6 > C2H4) have been reported in recent years, which can directly obtain purified C2H4 by the selective adsorption of C2H6 through the reversed affinity and adsorption capacity of the frameworks to the C2H6/C2H4 mixture. (22-26) As a simple, efficient, and green adsorbent, this type of MOFs with reversed adsorption characteristics is in line with the current global energy saving and emission reduction trend, so it is worth exploring further.
  </p>
  <p>
   Herein, inspired by the fascinating characteristics of selective adsorption of alkane, we construct a microporous MOF, NUM-7, with one-dimensional (1D) channels having completely reversed selectivity for C2 hydrocarbons through selecting a tetra-carboxylate ligand. Unlike the traditional impression of the interaction between MOFs and C2 hydrocarbons, NUM-7a (the activated NUM-7) exhibits a unique and strong affinity for C2H6 with a completely reversed relationship of affinities and adsorption capacities among C2 hydrocarbons (C2H6 > C2H4 > C2H2). Since the content of C2H4 in the product obtained by C2H6 cracking can reach several to several tens of times that of C2H6, the requirement for adsorption capacity to obtain equal amount of purified ethylene can be largely reduced for C2H6-selectivity MOFs, which means that it is expected that two relatively contradictory properties of high selectivity and high adsorption capacity in C2H4-selectivity MOFs will be realized simultaneously by C2H6-selectivity MOFs. Based on the unique reversed relationship of the adsorption capacities of the framework for C2 hydrocarbons, a one-step greener purification of C2H4 can be achieved through the selective adsorption of C2H6 with the energy consumption decreasing by 40% in industrial separation, which omitted the desorption process compared to the MOFs with C2H4-selectivity.

   Materials and Methods
  </h2>
  <p>
   All of the reagents and solvents were purchased from commercial suppliers and used without further purification. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and variable temperature powder X-ray diffraction (VT-PXRD) data were collected on a Rigaku Miniflex 600 at 40 kV and 15 mA with a scan rate of 6.0° min-1 using Cu Kα radiation in an air atmosphere (3° ≤ 2θ ≤ 60°). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) studies were carried out on a Rigaku standard thermogravimetry-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) analyzer from room temperature to 800 °C under air atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 °C min-1, using an empty and clean Al2O3 crucible as a reference.

  <h2>
   Synthesis of NUM-7
  </h2>
  <p>
   A mixture of MnCl2 4H2O (0.1 mmol, 0.020 g) and H4TCPE (0.01 mmol, 10 mg, H4TCPE = 4,4′,4″,4‴-(ethene-1,1,2,2-tetrayl) tetrabenzoic acid) was dissolved by dimethylformamide (DMF) (1.5 mL), CH3CN (1 mL), and deionized water (0.25 mL) in a 10 mL screw-capped glass vial, and then the sealed vial was heated to 85 °C for 72 h, which was then cooled to room temperature. The light yellow stick crystals obtained were washed several times with DMF for single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Yield: about 93% based on H4TCPE.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Activation of NUM-7
  </h2>
  <p>
   The as-synthesized NUM-7 was washed several times with DMF. Whereafter, fast and frequent guest solvents are exchanged for 6 h using absolute methanol to replace the DMF and CH3CN solvent molecules in the channels. After filtering, the guest-exchanged NUM-7 was activated at 150 °C for 10 h under vacuum conditions (less than 10-5 Torr), giving NUM-7a.

  <h2>
   Gas Sorption Measurements
  </h2>
  <p>
   N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms from 0 to 1 bar at 77 K with liquid nitrogen were measured by a Micrometrics ASAP 2460 volumetric gas adsorption analyzer. The measurements of gas adsorption of hydrocarbons from 273 to 313 K precisely controlled through a LAUDR RP890 recirculating control system with absolute ethyl alcohol were carried out by a Micrometrics ASAP 2020M volumetric gas adsorption analyzer.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Crystallography
  </h2>
  <p>
   The single-crystal X-ray diffraction data of NUM-7 were collected on a Rigaku XtaLAB Pro MM007HF DW diffractometer at 100 K with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54184 Å) by scan mode. The structure was solved and refined by the full-matrix least-squares method through Olex2 software (27) with the SHELXT (28) and SHELXL (29) program, respectively. The details have been listed in Table S1, and the crystallographic data have been deposited in the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center (CCDC number 1951489).

   Results and Discussion
  </h2>
  <h2>
   Single-Crystal X-ray Structure
  </h2>
  <p>
   The single crystals of NUM-7 ([Mn2(TCPE)(DMF)(H2O)] (DMF)(CH3CN)) were obtained using a simple and convenient one-pot solvothermal reaction of manganese chloride tetrahydrate (MnCl2 4H2O) and H4TCPE in a DMF/CH3CN mixture solvent. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction revealed that NUM-7 is in the clinorhombic crystal group with the P21/c space group (more details of the crystal structure are shown in Table S1). The asymmetric unit of NUM-7 contains one complete 4-connected ligand (TCPE4-) (Figure 1a), two independent but different hexacoordinated Mn(II) ions and two more solvent molecules (a DMF molecule and an H2O molecule), which coordinated with two Mn(II) ions, respectively (Figure S1). Also, each pair of different hexacoordinated Mn(II) ions construct a dual-core secondary building unit (SBU) connected by three carboxyl groups (Figure 1b), with two carboxyl groups adopting a bidentate bridging mode and one adopting a bidentate 1,3-chelating mode. The repeated 6-connected dual-core SBUs form the infinitely extendable Mn-O chain SBU by sharing oxygen atoms from DMF molecules and carboxyl groups, respectively. The overall three-dimensional (3D) structure in a shape of a fence is constructed by ligands and SBU chains, which has narrow approximated rectangular 1D channels with a scale of about 4.7 × 7.8 Å2 along b-axis built by multiple rotatable phenyl rings.

  <h2>
   Stabilities of NUM-7
  </h2>
  <p>
   The stabilities of NUM-7 were demonstrated by PXRD and TGA. The PXRD patterns indicate that NUM-7 can remain stable in most common solvents (Figure S2). As shown in Figures S3 and S4, TGA and VT-PXRD show that the structure of NUM-7 can be maintained to at least 160 °C, and with the increase of temperature, the framework changed and eventually collapsed at about 400 °C. In addition, the crystalline feature of NUM-7 can also be maintained after removing the solvents in the pore (Figure S5). It can be seen that NUM-7 has excellent stability, which is vital for its subsequent applications in adsorption and separation.

  <h2>
   Reversed Gas Sorption Properties of NUM-7a
  </h2>
  <p>
   N2-gas adsorption and desorption curves of NUM-7a at 77 K were measured to assess the permanent porosity. As shown in Figure S6, the fully reversible type I isotherm with a sharp uptake at P/P0 < 0.05 reveals the microporous nature of NUM-7a. The N2-gas physisorption reached a balanced plateau at P/P0 > 0.05, with a saturation uptake of 125.9 cm3 g-1. According to the measured N2 adsorption results, the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (Langmuir) surface area of NUM-7a is 345 m2 g-1 (526 m2 g-1), and pore volume is 0.194 cm3 g-1, obtained by calculation. The aperture of 1D channels in NUM-7a is about 3.42 Å, obtained by the Horvath-Kawazoe method (Figure S7).
  </p>
  <p>
   Exactly as the pre-expectation of the designed structure, NUM-7a has 1D narrow channels with a faceted hole wall made up of many phenyl rings, which portends that the framework is expected to have a stronger host-guest interaction with C2H6. (30-32) So, the C2 hydrocarbons single-component adsorption isotherms of NUM-7a were measured at 273, 298, and 313 K, respectively. The adsorption isotherms of C2 hydrocarbons from 273 to 313 K with pressure up to 1 bar were investigated as shown in Figure 2. A peculiar whole reversed adsorption phenomenon of C2 hydrocarbons was observed, which broke our normal cognition about the relationship among C2 hydrocarbons. At 273 K, although the adsorption capacities at 1 bar of C2H6 (69.5 cm3 g-1), C2H4 (69.3 cm3 g-1), and C2H2 (67.0 cm3 g-1) are abnormally close, a steeper rising trend in the type I curve of C2H6 compared to C2H4 and C2H2 can be observed from 0 to 0.2 bar in Figure 2a-c, which indicates that C2H6 has a stronger host-guest interaction with NUM-7a. As the temperature increases, this unique reversed adsorption phenomenon is amplified. At 298 K, the adsorption capacity of C2H6 (63.9 cm3 g-1) is significantly higher than that of C2H4 (58.6 cm3 g-1) and C2H2 (55.5 cm3 g-1) while maintaining a steeper curve rising trend of C2H6 than C2H4 and C2H2 in the low-pressure region. As the temperature rises further to 313 K, the relationship between the adsorption curves remains consistent with that at 298 K despite a slight decrease in adsorption capacities of C2H6 (58.1 cm3 g-1), C2H4 (52.1 cm3 g-1), and C2H2 (49.4 cm3 g-1). In general, as the temperature increases, the saturated adsorption capacity of each component decreases, but the difference between the three components is gradually amplified, as shown in Figure 2d. Comparison of some other gases adsorption curves, as shown in Figures S8-S11, NUM-7a exhibits significant differences in its adsorption capacities for C2H2, CO2, and CH4. For C2H2 and CO2, the difference in adsorption curves is very obvious in the low-pressure region. The curve of C2H2 is significantly steeper than that of CO2, and about 75% of the adsorption capacity is filled in 0-0.1 bar, which indicates that C2H2 has a stronger interaction with the framework than CO2. Also, for CO2 and CH4, the CO2 adsorption capacity is more than double that of CH4, and the curve of CH4 rises very gently with increasing pressure, which shows a weak affinity between CH4 and framework. Considering the above factors, NUM-7a has potential in the separation of C2H2/CO2 and CO2/CH4.
  </p>
  <p>
   Considering the above uncommon phenomena, the coverage-dependent adsorption enthalpies (Qst) of NUM-7a for C2H6, C2H4, and C2H2 were evaluated experimentally from single-component isotherms by the implementation of a virial equation (Figures 3 and S12-S14). The resultant Qst relationship at zero coverage among C2H6 (35.8 kJ mol-1), C2H4 (30.0 kJ mol-1), and C2H2 (29.3 kJ mol-1) is indeed in good agreement with the unique reversed adsorption phenomenon previously seen. Moreover, with the increase of coverage, the interaction between C2H4 and the framework gradually decreases, and the adsorption enthalpy shows a slight downward trend. However, due to the interaction between guest molecules, the adsorption enthalpy of C2H6 shows an upward trend with the increase in adsorption amount. The difference in affinity between C2H6/C2H4 and NUM-7a is amplified due to the above changes in adsorption enthalpies, which is advantageous for the challenging and rewarding C2H6/C2H4 separation.
  </p>
  <p>
   To structurally understand this kind of reversed strength of host-guest interactions, the distribution of C2 hydrocarbons molecules in NUM-7a at 298 K and 1 bar had been confirmed by grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulation. (33,34) The calculation results indicated that the host-guest interaction strength relationship between C2 hydrocarbons and the framework is indeed C2H6 > C2H4 > C2H2 (Figures 4 and S15-S18). Also, the reason why the C2 hydrocarbons can have such a strong force with the framework is that the existence of C-H O and C-H π interactions between guests and hosts. As shown in Figure 4a, C2H6 molecule has the largest size and the most complex 3D configuration in C2 hydrocarbons, and it can interact more strongly with the microporous channel walls through C-H O (H O2, 2.50 Å < 2.72 Å, the sum of van der Waals radii of oxygen (1.52 Å) and hydrogen (1.20 Å) atoms) and C-H π (H π, 2.84-3.68 Å) interactions. Due to the planar configuration of C2H4 and the smaller molecular size, fewer hydrogen atoms can only form weaker interactions with the surrounding oxygen and benzene rings (C-H O2, 2.56 Å < 2.72 Å, C-H π, 3.07-4.05 Å), as shown in Figure 4b. In view of the above results, the linear C2H2 molecule and the framework obviously have the weakest interaction, even the smallest C-H O (H O4, 2.77 Å) distance exceeded the sum of the van der Waals radii of hydrogen and oxygen atoms, and the weak C-H π (H π, 3.59-4.60 Å) interaction becomes weaker than that of C2H6 and C2H4. According to the above calculation results, it is precisely because of the difference in molecular size and spatial configuration that the molecule, which has more hydrogen atoms and large size, can form stronger interactions with the channel walls, resulting in the formation of a complete reversed affinity for the C2 hydrocarbons.

   Evaluation of Separation Performance
  </h2>
  <p>
   Based on this unique affinity reversed relationship of NUM-7a, the adsorption selectivity of binary mixtures C2H6/C2H4 in ratios of 50/50 (v/v) and 10/90 (v/v) at 298 K (Figure 5) and some other binary mixture gases (Figures S19-S27) were evaluated by ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST). The estimated selectivities of NUM-7a for C2H6/C2H4 at 298 K and 1 bar are 1.764 and 1.757 in 50/50 and 10/90, respectively. Among the reported MOFs, the selectivity of NUM-7a at 298 K and 1 bar in 50/50 is higher than that of most C2H6-selectivity MOFs, which is higher than that of ZJU-30 (1.7), (36) ZIF-7 (1.5), (37) UTSA-33 (1.4), (38) and so forth (Table S3), (24,30,32,35,39,40) but lower than that of Fe(O2)dobdc (4.25), (22) Cu(Qc)2 (3.4), (41) and MUF-15 (1.95). (25) The selectivities of C2H2/CO2 and CO2/CH4 are as shown in Figures S26 and S27.
  </p>
  <p>
   Building on above results, the separation performance of NUM-7a for C2H6/C2H4 (50/50 and 10/90) has been evaluated through breakthrough simulation experiment at 298 K. The transient breakthrough simulations show the concentrations of C2H6/C2H4 exiting the adsorber packed with NUM-7a as a function of the dimensionless time, τ (Figure 6). The breakthrough simulations demonstrate the potential of producing nearly pure product gas C2H4 during the time interval Δτ for both 50/50 and 10/90 C2H6/C2H4 mixtures, which indicates that NUM-7a has potential application in the challenging separation of C2H6/C2H4 in practice.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Conclusions
  </h2>
  <p>
   We have developed a new microporous MOF (NUM-7a) showing a stronger affinity for C2H6 among C2 hydrocarbons by selecting a small multibenzene ring ligand. NUM-7a exhibits an infrequent completely reversed adsorption relationship for C2 hydrocarbons (C2H6 > C2H4 > C2H2) at the same condition, which breaks the traditional concept of adsorption relationship of MOFs for C2 hydrocarbons. Based on this reversed adsorption phenomenon, the potential of NUM-7a in the separation of C2H6/C2H4 had been studied. The results demonstrated that C2H4 is expected to be directly and efficiently purified by a one-step green process through C2H6-selectivity NUM-7a.
