   Abstract

  <p>
   High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideThe selective capture of C2H6 from C2H6/C2H4 mixtures is of critical importance to realize the efficient one-step purification of C2H4 but remains challenging due to their similar properties and smaller quadrupole moment of C2H6 that usually result in C2H4-preferring adsorption. Herein, we reported two isostructural pillared-layer metal-organic frameworks, ZUL-C3 and ZUL-C4, which were constructed by mixed polycycloalkane-type ligands. Their low-polar pore environment along with more accessible low-polar C-H binding sites on the pore surface are conducive to generate more van der Waals interactions with C2H6 while the carboxylic groups distributed at four corners of pores form stronger and more dipolar interactions with C2H6, cooperatively resulting in a good C2H6/C2H4 uptake ratio of 1.50 for ZUL-C3 and 1.72 for ZUL-C4 in static adsorption experiments and a high C2H4 ( > 99.99% purity) productivity of 10.1 L/kg for ZUL-C3 and 14.6 L/kg for ZUL-C4 from an equimolar C2H6/C2H4 mixture in breakthrough experiments.

   1. Introduction
  </h2>
  <p>
   Ethylene (C2H4) is the essential raw material for the production of synthetic fiber, rubber, polyvinyl chloride, and other organic products, (1,2) with a predicted annual global production capacity of more than 200 million tons in 2023 and an annual growth rate of about 5%. (3,4) Since C2H4 is mainly produced by steam cracking or thermal decomposition of ethane (C2H6) in the industry, (5) C2H6 inevitably coexists as the contaminant that seriously affects the purity of the C2H4 product, making the follow-up removal of C2H6 indispensable for the production of polymer-grade C2H4 ( ≥ 99.95%). (6,7) Currently, cryogenic distillation, with a high pressure over 20 bar and low temperature below 243 K, is the main method that is applied in the industrial separation. (8-10) However, due to the close boiling point of C2H4 (169.42 K) and C2H6 (184.55 K), large distillation columns with 120 to 180 trays and high reflux ratios are required, leading to intensive energy consumption. (11)
  </p>
  <p>
   Adsorption separation offers less energy-extensive technical way by circumventing phase changes during the separation process. (12,13) Tremendous efforts have been devoted to the development of ultramicroporous adsorbents that can realize the efficient separation of C2H4/C2H6, and more than 600 adsorbents have been reported. Most of them showed an adsorption preference of C2H4 from the C2H4/C2H6 mixture due to the larger quadrupole moment (1.50 × 10-26 esu cm2 for C2H4; 0.65 × 10-26 esu cm2 for C2H6) and more π electrons of C2H4 that enabled the stronger interactions between the C2H4 molecule and the open metal sites or highly polar groups on the adsorbent pore surface. (14-24) However, their similar molecular size tends to result in co-adsorption phenomenon, seriously reducing the product purity of C2H4. Even for those adsorbents that realized molecule exclusion of C2H6, (25,26) a large quantity of the adsorbent will be needed on account of the high concentration of C2H4 (usually >95%, v/v) in the mixture, and an additional desorption process is required to get the C2H4 product from C2H4-loaded adsorbents, increasing the energy consumption and complicating the separation process. (27-30) Therefore, it is extremely urgent and necessary to construct new C2H6-preferring adsorbents to realize an efficient one-step purification of C2H4.
  </p>
  <p>
   Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), self-assembled by inorganic metal nodes or metal clusters with organic bridging ligands, are well-known for their tailored-to-application tunability of pore structures and pore environment, which have showed huge potential in the construction of C2H6-preferred adsorbents. (31-35) As previous research studies indicated, creating a non-polar/inert pore environment is considered as an effective method to avoid strong interactions between the framework and C2H4, and some MOFs with this feature have been reported. (36-42) However, the paucity of strong binding sites may also lead to poor capture of C2H6 and thus low C2H6/C2H4 selectivity. It is conceivable that more low-polar binding sites on the pore surface should be beneficial to the selective capture of C2H6 due to multiple van der Waals interactions. (43,44) Besides, methyl groups make the C2H6 molecule wider and bulkier than C2H4 (Table S1), which provides more opportunity for C2H6 to get close the pore corners. Therefore, a rational arrangement of polar groups at the corners would offer the possibility to generate strong dipolar interactions between C2H6 and the framework and realize the selective adsorption of C2H6.
  </p>
  <p>
   Herein, we reported two isostructural pillared-layer MOFs, Cu(bpdc)(ted)0.5 (ZUL-C3) and Ni(bpdc)(ted)0.5 (ZUL-C4), that employed bicycle[1.1.1]pentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid (H2bpdc) and 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (ted) as mixed ligands. Compared with common linear/branched alkane-type ligands or decorated alkane ligands, these polycycloalkane-type ligands provided more accessible low-polar C-H binding sites that were conducive to generate more van der Waals interactions with C2H6. Moreover, their comparable pore size with C2H6 and the carboxylic groups distributed at four corners of pores provided possibility to form stronger and more dipolar interactions between C2H6 and carboxylic groups, cooperatively resulting in a relatively firm grasp of C2H6. As a result, ZUL-C3 and ZUL-C4 exhibited good C2H6/C2H4 uptake ratio of 1.50 and 1.72 in static adsorption experiments, which exceeded most of top-performing C2H6-selective preferring MOFs. Besides, high-pure C2H4 ( > 99.9999% purity) can be obtained by ZUL-C3 and ZUL-C4 directly from C2H6/C2H4 mixtures in the breakthrough experiments, confirming them potential candidates for C2H6/C2H4 separation.

  <p>
   38.7 mg (0.16 mmol) of nickel(II) chloride hexahydrate (NiCl2 6H2O) was dissolved in 3.75 mL of DMF. Then, 0.03 mL (0.05 mmol) of acetic acid was added; 23.4 mg (0.15 mmol) of bicycle[1.1.1]pentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid (H2bpdc) and 9.0 mg (0.08 mmol) of 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (ted) were mixed in 2.50 mL of DMF.

After heating at 393 K for 48 h, green needle-shaped single crystals were formed.
  </p>
  <h2>
   2.2. Characterization Methods
  </h2>
  <p>
   The thermal gravimetric analysis was performed on SDT650. Experiments were carried out using an alumina pan under nitrogen flow with a heating rate of 10 K/min from room temperature to 1073 K. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data were collected on a PANalytical X'Pert diffractometer (Cu Kα, λ = 1.540598 Å) with a step size of 0.026° and 30 s/step measuring time. The range of 2θ was from 5 to 60°.
  </p>
  <h2>
   2.3. Gas Adsorption Measurements
  </h2>
  <p>
   Before adsorption isotherms test, the synthesized samples were washed with 10 mL of DMF and 10 mL of ethanol three times each and then dried and degassed under high vacuum ( < 10 μmHg) at 393 K for 24 h. Gas adsorption measurements were conducted on a Micrometrics ASAP 2460 gas adsorption analyzer at 273 and 298 K.
  </p>
  <h2>
   2.4. Breakthrough Experiment
  </h2>
  <p>
   The breakthrough experiments were carried out in a dynamic gas breakthrough equipment. (43) ZUL-C3 (1379.8 mg) and ZUL-C4 (607.7 mg) were activated and then packed into stainless-steel columns (4.6 mm inner diameter × 30 mm). These columns were first purged with N2 flow (15 mL/min) for 24 h at 393 K. The binary equimolar gas mixture of C2H6/C2H4 was then introduced at 0.5 mL/min. Outlet gas from the column was monitored using gas chromatography (GC-2010 pro, SHIMADZU) with a flame ionization detector. When the breakthrough experiments were finished, the column was heated to 308 K, a flow rate of 1.8 mL/min N2 was introduced, and the outlet gas from the column was also monitored. The actual gas uptake capacity obtained by the desorption process was calculated using the following equationqdesi = ∫0t0FdesCidtm(1)where qdesi was the uptake capacity of the gas component i calculated from the desorption process, Fdes was the total outlet flow rate which was calculated based on the flow rate of nitrogen and the concentration of each gas component, and Ci was the concentration of gas i in the outlet gas mixture.
  </p>
  <h2>
   2.5. Density Functional Theory Calculations
  </h2>
  <p>
   The static binding energy was calculated using the combination of first-principle density functional theory (DFT) and plane-wave ultrasoft pseudopotential implemented in the Materials Studio, CASTEP code. (45) A semi-empirical addition of dispersive forces to conventional DFT was included in the calculation to account for van der Waals interactions. Calculations were performed under the generalized gradient approximation with Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof exchange correlation. (45) A cutoff energy of 544 eV while a 3 × 3 × 3 k-point mesh for ZUL-C3 and ZUL-C4 were found to be sufficient for total energy to converge within 0.02 meV/atom. Activated structures were first optimized. The optimized structures matched well with the experimentally determined structures. Then, the isolated gas molecule was placed in the same cell dimensions as every sample crystal and was optimized and relaxed as references. Various guest gas molecules were finally introduced to different locations of the channel pore, followed by a full structural relaxation. The static binding energy (at T = 0 K) was then calculated: ΔE = E(MOF) + E(gas) - E(MOF + gas).

   3. Results and Discussion
  </h2>
  <h2>
   3.1. Structural Characterization
  </h2>
  <p>
   ZUL-C3 was successfully synthesized according to our previous report, (12) and ZUL-C4 was synthesized by heating the mixture of DMF/ethanol solution of Ni(NO3)2 6H2O, H2bpdc, and ted at 413 K for 24 h for the first time. The experimental PXRD data revealed that ZUL-C4 was isostructural with ZUL-C3. Their paddle-wheel units M2(COO)4 (M = Ni, Cu) are connected by bpdc ligands to form rhombic-grid layers. Ted ligands coordinate to the paddle-wheels along the axial directions, pillaring the layers into an overall 3D orthorhombic lattice (Table S2). As shown in Figure 1, the projected pore size of ZUL-C3 is 4.5 × 5.2 Å2 from the top view and 3.5 × 3.2 Å2 from the side view, while that of ZUL-C4 are 4.9 × 5.2 and 3.1 × 3.0 Å2, respectively. After desolvation, both ZUL-C3 and ZUL-C4 changed to a tetragonal lattice (Table S3). As calculated by Zeo++ with a probe radius of 1.82 Å, the largest cavity diameter and the pore limiting diameter of activated ZUL-C4 are 7.51 and 3.27 Å, slightly smaller than that of ZUL-C3 (7.67 and 3.87 Å). The projected pore size from the top view in ZUL-C4 is 3.4 × 3.4 Å2, which is the same as ZUL-C3, while that from the side view is 3.2 × 4.1 Å2, obviously smaller than that in ZUL-C3 (3.6 × 4.2 Å2). The phase purity of powder ZUL-C3 and ZUL-C4 was verified by the consistence of the simulated and experimental PXRD data (Figures 2a and S1). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of these two materials revealed that they have good thermal stability up to 533 K in the N2 atmosphere (Figures S2 and S3). Their permanent porosity was confirmed by N2 sorption isotherms at 77 K (Figures S4-S7), which both showed type I isotherm with a calculated Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area of 1200 m2/g for ZUL-C3 and 1190 m2/g for ZUL-C4. The derived pore size of ZUL-C3 from N2 adsorption isotherms at 77 K is 6.16 Å, while that of ZUL-C3 is 6.00 Å, consistent with the analysis from single-crystal structures.

  <h2>
   3.2. Gas Adsorption Analysis
  </h2>
  <p>
   To explore the adsorption behavior of C2H4 and C2H6 on ZUL-C3 and ZUL-C4, single-component adsorption isotherms were measured at 298 and 273 K. As shown in Figure 2b, C2H6 isotherms of both materials exhibited steeper increasing trend than C2H4, implying a higher adsorption affinity of framework to C2H6. This was also supported by the adsorption enthalpy measured using the differential scanning calorimeter method (Figures S8 and S9). The adsorption enthalpies of C2H4 and C2H6 for ZUL-C3 were 19.9 and 29.5 kJ/mol and for ZUL-C4 were 24.3 and 31.6 kJ/mol, respectively, suggesting that both ZUL-C3 and ZUL-C4 have the ability to preferentially capture C2H6 from the C2H6/C2H4 mixture based on a thermodynamic mechanism. The adsorption capacities of C2H6 in ZUL-C3 and ZUL-C4 were 2.30 mmol/g (1.26 molecule per cell) and 2.93 mmol/g (1.58 molecule per cell) at 298 K, 100 kPa, while those of C2H4 were 1.53 mmol/g (0.88 molecule per cell) and 1.70 mmol/g (0.91 molecule per cell), respectively. The C2H6/C2H4 uptake ratio for ZUL-C3 reached 1.50 and for ZUL-C4 reached 1.72, which surpassed many top-performing C2H6-preferring adsorbents, like FJI-H11-Me(des) (1.24), (4) Fe2(O2)(dobdc) (1.26), (9) and Zn-FBA (1.10). (46) Besides, it is worth noting that a slight "adsorption step" was observed in the C2H6 isotherm of ZUL-C4 at about 95 kPa, 298 K. With the temperature decreasing to 273 K, "adsorption steps" appeared in both MOFs because the higher adsorption amount at lower temperature induced a framework lattice transformation at relatively low pressures. At 273 K, the C2H6 uptake exhibited earlier steep increase than that of C2H4, suggesting a stronger capture of C2H6 than C2H4 in both materials. Moreover, the threshold pressure of C2H6 in ZUL-C4 was about 30 kPa, much earlier than that in ZUL-C3 (about 55 kPa), and the C2H6 isotherm in ZUL-C4 exhibited sharper inflections than that in ZUL-C3, implying a stronger capture of C2H6 in ZUL-C4 (Figures S10 and S11). The adsorption capacities of C2H6 reached 4.90 mmol/g in ZUL-C3 and 5.08 mmol/g in ZUL-C4 at 100 kPa, which remained higher than that of C2H4, indicating the C2H6-preference even at high loadings. Since ZUL-C3 and ZUL-C4 both exhibited an orthorhombic lattice with solvent-loaded but a tetragonal lattice with solvent-removed, it is conceivable that these "adsorption steps" are related to structural transformations from the tetragonal lattice (before adsorption steps) to the orthorhombic lattice (after adsorption steps) as the adsorption amounts increase. Moreover, in order to clarify the adsorption mechanism, it is of great importance to confirm their structures when loaded with saturated C2H4 or C2H6 at 298 K, 100 kPa. Thus, PXRD patterns of ZUL-C3 and ZUL-C4 were measured after adsorbing C2H4 or C2H6, and they were all identical with those after activation (Figures S12 and S13), indicating that they maintained their tetragonal lattice under this circumstance.
  </p>
  <p>
   Motivated by the distinction in adsorption affinity and uptake capacity between C2H6 and C2H4 in ZUL-C3 and ZUL-C4, the IAST selectivities were calculated for C2H6/C2H4 (50/50) mixtures at 298 K, which exhibited descending trend in the range of 0-100 kPa and reached 2.04 in ZUL-C3 and 2.21 in ZUL-C4 at 100 kPa (Figure 2c, Tables S4-S6), outperforming many reported C2H6-selective MOFs, like Ni(bdc)(ted)0.5 (1.6), (47) UiO-67-(NH2)2 (1.7), (48) and Zn4O(NTB)2 (2.02) (49) (Figure 2d and Table S7). Besides, the corresponding separation potential of ZUL-C3 and ZUL-C4 for C2H6/C2H4 (50:50) mixtures were 0.664 and 0.805 mol/kg, respectively, at 298 K, 100 kPa, implying their potential for C2H6/C2H4 separation. Meanwhile, kinetic studies suggested that both C2H4 and C2H6 diffused quickly in the pores and reached equilibrium within 4 min (Figures S14 and S15), which was beneficial for the adsorption efficiency, and this result also confirmed the dominant role of thermodynamic factors in the separation.
  </p>
  <p>
   To validate the practical C2H6/C2H4 separation performance of these new materials, breakthrough experiments were conducted at 298 K, in which a binary equimolar gas mixture of C2H6/C2H4 was introduced to packed columns containing activated ZUL-C3 or ZUL-C4 at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. As shown in Figure 3a,b, both ZUL-C3 and ZUL-C4 successfully realized the selective capture of C2H6 from the C2H6/C2H4 (50/50) mixture. For ZUL-C3, C2H4 penetrated first (outlet concentration > 100 ppm) at 40.3 min/g, whereas C2H6 retained for 57.6 min/g, representing a gap of breakthrough time (the breakthrough time of C2H6 minus that of C2H4) of 17.3 min/g. For ZUL-C4, with higher C2H6 capacity and C2H6/C2H4 selectivity as indicated by gas adsorption analysis, the breakthrough time of C2H4 (53.3 min/g) and C2H6 (81.2 min/g) were both longer than those in ZUL-C3, and their gap was also increased to 27.9 min/g. Consequently, the high-purity C2H4 productivity ( > 99.99% purity, the instrument detection limit is 0.01%) that calculated by numerical integration (Figures S16 and S17) was increased from 10.1 to 14.6 L/kg, which surpassed most of the literature MOFs, such as MAF-49 (6.2 L/kg), (36) Cu(Qc)2 (4.3 L/kg), (37) and ZIF-8 (1.2 L/kg). (50) The accurate dynamic gas uptakes were calculated from desorption processes conducted at 308 K. With a flow rate of 1.8 mL/min N2 introduced, both C2H4 and C2H6 adsorbed can be fully desorbed within 60 min/g, indicating their easy regeneration in ZUL-C3 and ZUL-C4 (Figures 3c and S18). The dynamic adsorption capacity of C2H6 and C2H4 was 1.06 and 0.57 mmol/g for ZUL-C3 and 1.17 and 0.60 mmol/g for ZUL-C4, respectively. Their corresponding dynamic selectivities were 1.86 and 1.95, which were in accordance with IAST selectivities. Furthermore, multiple breakthrough tests were conducted under the same operation conditions, and these materials maintained their selectivity and capacity in five runs (Figures S19 and S20), indicating their recyclability and stable separation performance.

  <h2>
   3.4. Computational Simulation Studies
  </h2>
  <p>
   To provide insights into the host-guest interactions between the framework and adsorbates, first-principle dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT-D) calculations were performed to ascertain the adsorption sites in these MOFs and calculate corresponding binding energies. As expected from the adsorption experiments, C2H6 exhibited a higher binding energy than C2H4 in both ZUL-C3 and ZUL-C4. As shown in Figure 4, their optimal adsorption sites were all at the center of the pore window on the bc plane. In ZUL-C3, four C-H O dipolar interactions were observed between C2H6 and the carboxylate group (3.84, 3.90, 3.97, and 3.99 Å), and several C-H C interactions were formed between the alkyl groups of bpdc ligands and C2H6 (2.95, 2.96, 3.10, and 3.16 Å). As for C2H4 with fewer C-H bonds, fewer C-H O and C-H C interactions were observed, exhibiting lower binding energies of 28.98 kJ/mol than C2H6 (40.47 kJ/mol). In ZUL-C4, the slight shrinkage of pores shortened the distance between guest molecules and the framework. The methyl groups of C2H6 were close to the aliphatic bridged-polycyclic hydrocarbon moieties of both bpdc ligands and ted ligands, contributing to more and stronger C-H C van der Waals interactions (2.94, 2.95, 2.98, 3.07, 3.09, and 3.10 Å). Besides, shorter C-H O bonds between C2H6 and the electronegative oxygen atoms were also observed (3.27, 3.39, 3.40, and 3.71 Å), cooperatively resulting in a relatively high binding energy of 42.62 kJ/mol. Similar to ZUL-C3, there was also a substantial discrepancy in binding energy between C2H6 and C2H4 in ZUL-C4. Weaker C-H C van der Waals interactions (2.94, 2.98, 3.06, 3.08, 3.21, and 3.23 Å) and fewer C-H O dipolar interactions (3.48, 3.78 Å) were formed between C2H4 and ZUL-C4, causing a lower binding energy of 35.86 kJ/mol than C2H6.
  </p>
  <h2>
   4. Conclusions
  </h2>
  <p>
   In summary, we reported two isostructural pillared-layer MOFs, ZUL-C3 and ZUL-C4, consisting of M2(COO)4 (M = Cu and Ni) clusters and polycycloalkane-type mixed ligands, which exhibited good C2H6/C2H4 uptake ratio of 1.50 and 1.72 in static adsorption experiments and a high C2H4 ( > 99.99% purity) productivity of 10.1 L/kg and 14.6 L/kg from the equimolar C2H6/C2H4 mixture in breakthrough experiments. As indicated by DFT-D calculations, the dense alkyl groups provided by polycycloalkane-type ligands and the carboxylic groups distributed at four corners of pores contributed to forming more C-H C van der Waals interactions and C-H O dipolar interactions between C2H6 and frameworks, cooperatively guaranteeing C2H6 molecules firmly grasped within the framework. The successful application of these two MOFs in C2H6/C2H4 separation not only provided a new reference for the rational design of C2H6-preferring MOFs but also encourage researchers to apply them in other challenging paraffin/olefin separations.
