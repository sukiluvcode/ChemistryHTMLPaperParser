  <p>
   High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideThe separation of light hydrocarbon mixtures is one of the most important yet energy-intensive processes in the petrochemical industry. Solid adsorbent materials could potentially not only lower energy costs but also offer higher efficiency as an alternative means to traditionally energy-intensive separation methods such as distillation, absorption, and extraction. Here, rational augmentation of the metal-organic framework, Mg-MOF-74, was designed in silico to enhance kinetic selectivity of the material, while imposing a minimal reduction in the adsorption working capacities for light hydrocarbons. From the computer-aided design, we synthesized 2,4,6-tri(4-pyridyl)-1,3,5-triazine-inserted Mg-MOF-74 (tpt-Mg-MOF-74) and successfully characterized the structure. This material can kinetically separate ethane/propane with an unprecedented diffusive selectivity of ~49 owing to its distinctive pore size and provides evidence that metal-organic framework need not sacrifice pore volume for enhanced kinetic selectivity in separation applications.

  <h2>
   Introduction
  </h2>
  <p>
   Current industrial light hydrocarbon (C1-C4) processing is supported by highly energy-intensive separation techniques that use cryogenic phase transitions of condensable hydrocarbon molecules. (1,2) Notably, recent natural gas revolution has allowed for substantial recovery of high-value natural gas liquids (NGLs, ethane, propane) that are major feedstock in the chemical industry. (3) The worldwide production of NGLs has reached an enormous scale of up to five million barrels per year. (4) This presents a significant opportunity for dramatic reductions in energy and carbon intensity by replacing traditional "thermal" separations with advanced separations based on engineered nanoporous materials that can physically "sieve" and fractionate the NGLs without requiring these gas species to undergo bulk gas to liquid phase transitions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Because of their high surface areas and tunable pore chemistry, the separation capabilities of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have met or exceeded those achievable using conventional zeolite or carbon adsorbents. (5-7) Among numerous MOFs, M-MOF-74 [M2(dobdc), M = Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn; dobdc4- = 2,5-dioxido-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate] is one of the most academically and industrially highlighted porous materials because of facile synthesis, (8) high density of exposed metal sites, (9,10) and high surface areas. (11,12) Because the unsaturated metal sites in these M-MOF-74 structures provide strong binding sites for gas molecules, various metal analogues of MOF-74 have been used in olefin/paraffin separations (13,14) and complex light hydrocarbon mixtures containing C1-C3 gases. (1,15,16) 2,5-dioxido-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate (dobdc4-), the linker used to build MOF-74, is rigid and long enough to create a sufficiently large pore aperture (11.9 Å), which prompts fast kinetics for light hydrocarbon molecules (typically 3-6 Å in kinetic diameters) that enters the pores. However, such a large pore aperture cannot distinguish molecules with different sizes and shapes and, as such, provides little differentiation in terms of kinetics. This trade-off between adsorptive selectivity and diffusive selectivity sets a limitation to MOF-74 for hydrocarbon separation applications. To remedy this issue, one can simply choose a different MOF with a smaller aperture size, but this generally leads to a reduction in the working capacity of the light hydrocarbon gas molecules. As such, there is a pressing need to develop MOFs that simultaneously possess large gas uptake and high diffusion selectivity. To address this issue, we hypothesized that if one can alter the original MOF-74 structure to reduce its aperture size to the ultramicropore range ( < 6 Å) (17) with minimal loss in micropore volume where light hydrocarbon molecules "physically" sieve through this pore, then the aforementioned trade-off can be broken.
  </p>
  <p>
   In our previous computational work, we selected IRMOF-74 as a base prototype material and implemented the ligand-insertion strategy. Using computational analysis, these structures showed an increase in the working capacity of CO2 under humid flue gas conditions, (18) utility as a catalyst for enhanced ethane oxidation, (19) potential usage in water-harvesting material, (20) and reverse selectivity of hexane isomer separation. (21) As such, we initiated a plan to rationally select and insert ligands to reduce the pore aperture size of the pristine MOF-74 structure via the ligand-partition strategy. According to our simulation results, the rationally designed MOF-74 possesses the capability to sort light hydrocarbons with different kinetic diameters (4.0 Å for ethane and 4.2 Å for propane). Moreover, if the number of ligands is sufficiently small such that not all of the available metal sites are occupied with the ligands, the reduction in the working capacity will be small while diffusion will still be sensitive to the newly formed material, thereby breaking the trade-off between the working capacity and diffusion selectivity.

   Synthesis and Characterization
  </h2>
  <p>
   In this work, Mg2(dobdc) (CPO-27-Mg, Mg-MOF-74) was selected as the base MOF to apply the ligand-partition strategy. Mg2(dobdc) was synthesized using the previously reported method. (10) By inserting the ligand into the channel of the Mg-MOF-74 material, simultaneous metal-ligand bond (M-L bond) reaction occurred among the stoichiometric amounts of magnesium nitrate, 2,5-dihydroxyterephthalic acid, and 2,4,6-tri(4-pyridyl)-1,3,5-triazine (tpt) (products were denoted as Mg2(dobdc)-tpt) in heated N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). The adsorption isotherms of ethane and propane for each sample were measured through a volumetric adsorption apparatus. The adsorption kinetic uptake curves were obtained through a custom pressure decaying apparatus (see the Supporting Information for experimental details).
  </p>
  <h2>
   Computational Method
  </h2>
  <p>
   Geometry optimization, calculation of binding energies, and NMR shielding constants were conducted using the first-principles calculations through the density functional theory (DFT), as implemented by the plane-wave pseudopotential approach in Quantum Espresso. (22) All molecular dynamics (MD) simulations used to analyze the diffusion behavior of the ethane and propane molecules were carried out using the large-scale atomic/molecular massively parallel simulator (LAMMPS) program. (23) Also, the pore volume of MOFs was calculated using the Zeo++ software (24) (see the Supporting Information for computational details).
  </p>
  <h2>
   Results and Discussion
  </h2>
  <p>
   Among the M-MOF-74 structure with different metal types, Mg-MOF-74 was selected for our study, given its exceptionally high adsorption properties for small molecules. (25-27) Prior to experimental synthesis, the set of ligands that can potentially be inserted in the pores of the Mg-MOF-74 was identified from a list of all the linkers available in the CoRE MOF database. (28) From the set of 48 ligands (29,30) commonly used in the CoRE MOF data set, seven size-matching regulated ligands (7 Å < Dligand < 10 Å) were selected as candidates to be inserted into the Mg-MOF-74 structure (Figure 1a). From this reduced set, the binding energies within the pores of the Mg-MOF-74 were computed using quantum calculations (see Table S1).
  </p>
  <p>
   Next, pore sizes of the ligand-inserted Mg-MOF-74 were calculated using Zeo++ to filter for MOFs with optimal molecular gas separation (ethane/propane). Finally, MD simulations were performed to obtain the self-diffusion coefficients of ethane and propane in these MOFs. Among the candidate ligands, the 2,4,6-tri(4-pyridyl)-1,3,5-triazine (tpt) ligand was selected to possess the optimal properties for ethane/propane separation. Initially, the tpt ligand was inserted within the hexagonal channels of MOF-74, where each of the three nitrogen (one per 4-pyridyl ligand) atoms was next to the open metal sites (Figure 1b). The DFT binding energy of the tpt ligand inside the Mg-MOF-74 unit cell was computed to be -302.1 kJ/mol, which is significantly stronger than the binding energy of the DMF solvent (-107.6 kJ/mol), providing reliable evidence that the ligands would stay intact and not wash away during synthesis. With the inclusion of the tpt ligand, the pore limiting diameter of Mg-MOF-74 was reduced to around 4.2 Å, which is an ideal aperture size for ethane/propane separation. The pore size distribution (PSD) (31) for each structure was obtained, and it can be seen that the pore sizes of the tpt-Mg-MOF-74 are concentrated in the 3-4 Å range, while MOF-74 showed a prominent peak near 12 Å (Figure 1c). Based on these results, different diffusion properties of ethane and propane within the original Mg-MOF-74 structure and tpt-Mg-MOF-74 structure can be expected.
  </p>
  <p>
   To verify the predictions made from the simulation data, both Mg-MOF-74 and tpt-Mg-MOF-74 were synthesized in this work. Mg-MOF-74 was synthesized using the method reported by Britt et al.. (10) and tpt-Mg-MOF-74 was synthesized using the extra-framework M-L bond reaction. In order to figure out the crystal morphology and particle size of the material, our sample was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Figure 2a). The crystals of Mg-MOF-74 were synthesized with a particle size of less than 5 μm, which is consistent with previously reported experiments. (33) On the basis of the SEM images, it is reasonable to conclude that tpt-MOF-74 was well synthesized with the overall crystal structure intact. Next, the 13C spectra of MOF-74 and ligand-inserted MOF were measured without 1H decoupling. The spectra revealed good overall agreement between the calculated (based on the proposed structural model shown in Figure 2b) and the measured 13C isotropic chemical shifts. The maximum discrepancy between the calculated and the measured values is 4 ppm, whereas for the rest, the deviation is below 2 ppm. It seems that the GIPAW (34)-based prediction of 13C isotropic chemical shifts is quite reliable for the selected Mg-MOF-74 and that this approach can quite safely be used for the assignment of 13C NMR spectra. Taking a look at the NMR spectra, we note that the Mg-MOF-74 structure exhibits narrow and small intensity lines, whereas the lines in the spectrum of tpt-Mg-MOF-74 are sharp with high intensity. Compared to the Mg-MOF-74 spectra, the two peaks appear at around 175 ppm in the tpt-Mg-MOF-74 NMR spectra. The signal at 172 ppm carbon (from the carbon of carbonyl in the linker) is present in both the Mg-MOF-74 and tpt-Mg-MOF-74. However, the signal at 174 ppm carbon is only present in tpt-MOF-74 because of the carbon atoms being positioned adjacent to 1,3,5-triazine on the three sides. Moreover, the NMR measurements on acid-digested samples indicate that the tpt ligands were inserted within the tpt-Mg-MOF74 structure (Figure S6). This is surprising because powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) used for structural identification (Figure 2c) does not indicate any notable differences in the crystallinity between the two samples. The peaks of simulated Mg-MOF-74 at 6.8° and 12° match well with the characteristic peaks of synthesized Mg-MOF-74 as there is good agreement between the two patterns, indicating that the as-synthesized sample has the exact correct structure with good crystallinity. Furthermore, we carried out the synchrotron powder diffraction study using the supramolecular crystallography (SMC) beamline to support the structural information of tpt-Mg-MOF-74. In the ideal computational designed structure, the tpt ligands were inserted such that the distance between the two tpt ligands is 6.7 Å along the channel direction in the z-axis (Figure S3), indicating that the tpt ligands are tightly packed, while occupying all possible metal sites (100% occupancy). The tpt-Mg-MOF-74 showed an additional diffraction peak at 7.9°. In the simulated XRD data, the diffraction peak of XRD located at 2 theta = 7.9° corresponds to the distance between the two tpt ligands along the channel direction in the z-axis (Figure S7). On the other hand, there is no significant difference in the XRD peak in both the calculation and experimental results for Mg-MOF-74 and Mg-MOF-74 containing the ligand. These results indicate that the inserted ligands retain the crystallinity of MOF structures.

   Finally, the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area decreased slightly (1560 m2/g for Mg-MOF-74 and 1294 m2/g for tpt-Mg-MOF-74) and a similar level of reduction was seen in the t-plot micropore volume (0.595 cm3/g for Mg-MOF-74 and 0.500 cm3/g for tpt-Mg-MOF-74) (Figure 2d). (35) Our computational results indicate that when ligands are fully inserted into all of the available metal sites, the percentage reduction in pore volume would be significantly lower (64 percentage volume loss), providing indirect evidence that the ligand occupancy might be relatively low in the experimental Mg-MOF-74 structure, which has only 16 percentage volume loss. We further confirmed the insertion of the tpt ligand into the pores of the Mg-MOF-74 and tpt-Mg-MOF-74 structures through the laser desorption ionization-time of flight (LDI-TOF) technique (Figure S9). Only the tpt-Mg-MOF-74 showed a peak at 311.32 m/z, which corresponds to the molecular weight of the ionized tpt ligand. To clarify the amount of tpt loaded in the modified MOF, both activated and nonactivated samples were analyzed (Figure S10). However, because of the water adsorption of Mg-MOF-74, the activated sample underwent desolvation under 150 °C. At around 400 °C, structural degradation of MOFs began, and the mass sharply decreased. The dashed line indicates the point before structure degradation determined by the derivative thermogravimetric (DTG) curve. Both tpt-Mg-MOF-74 samples showed 2.4% (nonactivated) and 3.6% (activated) weight decrease compared to Mg-MOF-74. Through the calculation based on the remained magnesium oxide amount, the inserted tpt ligand amount can be calculated. For activated tpt-Mg-MOF-74, nearly 13% of the theoretical maximum amount of the tpt ligand was inserted and 10% for nonactivated tpt-Mg-MOF-74. These results coincided with elemental analysis (Table S2) and gas adsorption isotherm data.
  </p>
  <p>
   Next, the single-component experimental adsorption isotherm data for ethane and propane in Mg-MOF-74 and tpt-Mg-MOF-74 were obtained at 298 K, and the data were fitted with the Langmuir model (Figure 3a). Prior to measuring the gas uptake, both MOFs were activated at high temperatures under a vacuum to remove the solvent and moisture from the ultramicropore. However, this activation process could lead to the destruction of the well-inserted array of tpt ligands because the high surface tension of solvent molecules undergoes a phase change from liquid to gas at such conditions. To avoid potential damage to the ligand-inserted structure, supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) treatment was used to minimize the mechanical stress applied to the MOF crystals via smooth phase transition from the supercritical to gas phase during activation. (36) The ethane uptake at 298 K and 1 bar in Mg-MOF-74 was measured to be 6.1 mmol/g, while the propane uptake was 6.6 mmol/g. On the other hand, adsorption uptakes of ethane and propane in tpt-Mg-MOF-74 were 5.4 and 6.1 mmol/g, respectively. There is only a slight reduction in the uptake amount, which might be the sign that not all of the open metal sites are being occupied by the tpt ligands. (35) Isosteric heat of adsorption for each gas was calculated through adsorption equilibrium data at 298, 308, and 318 K as well (Figure S14).
  </p>
  <p>
   From the time-dependent experimental gas uptake profiles for both Mg-MOF-74 and tpt-Mg-MOF-74 (Figures S15-S18), the average diffusivity of Mg-MOF-74 for ethane and propane was calculated to be 28.3 × 10-12 cm2/s and 13.7 × 10-12 cm2/s. In tpt-Mg-MOF-74, the average diffusivities for ethane and propane were 30.3 × 10-12 cm2/s and 0.62 × 10-12 m2/s, respectively (Figure 3b). While the adsorption kinetics between ethane and propane did not show a large difference in Mg-MOF-74, ethane molecules diffused much faster in tpt-MOF-74 [the transport diffusivity and thermodynamically corrected diffusivity of ethane and propane molecules are summarized, respectively (Table 1)]. MD simulations were also conducted in the two structures, and the self-diffusivity of ethane and propane was obtained from the mean-squared displacement (MSD) (Figure 3c). For the Mg-MOF-74 structures, the diffusivities of ethane and propane have similar values of 20.1 × 10-12 m2/s and 16.1 × 10-12 m2/s, respectively. However, in the case of the tpt-Mg-MOF-74 structure with 100% ligand occupancy (where the maximum number of tpt ligands were occupied in the Mg-MOF-74 structure), diffusivities of ethane and propane were significantly different at 8.54 × 10-12 m2/s and 4.25 × 10-14 m2/s, respectively. The reduction in the pore size due to the inclusion of the ligands led to significant kinetic separation of ethane and propane, as surmised from our screening criterion. The tpt-Mg-MOF-74 showed a significantly high ethane/propane selectivity of 213 using the computational data compared with that of Mg-MOF-74 (selectivity of ~1.26). Similarly, the kinetic selectivity from experimental data was obtained to be 49 for tpt-Mg-MOF-74 and 2.07 for Mg-MOF-74 (Figure 3d). The MD snapshots are presented to visualize the trajectory of the ethane and propane molecules. The mobility of the ethane and propane molecules in 100% ligand occupancy seems to be largely dominated by their kinetic diameter (Figure 3e). As observed from the MSD data, both ethane and propane molecules easily diffuse through the Mg-MOF-74 channels. In the case of the tpt-Mg-MOF-74 structure, the ethane molecule has a smaller kinetic diameter than the aperture size and thus can freely rotate, leading to relatively fast diffusion despite the steric effect from ligand insertion. In contrast, propane molecules that have larger kinetic diameters than the aperture size slowly diffuse through the channels and are "stuck" inside the cage created between the two neighboring ligands, which results in overall poor diffusivity.

   To quantify the effect of the ligand proportion to the diffusion selectivity, the proportion of all available occupied sites was varied from 20 to 100% (Figure 4, and see Figures S21-S24 for individual ligand proportion data). The diffusivity of ethane and propane molecules reduces with the increasing proportion of the ligands (Figure 4). At a relatively low occupancy ( < 60%), the kinetic selectivity between ethane and propane is small as an ample amount of pore volume seems to free the movement of both the gas molecules. However, at a higher occupancy, the kinetic selectivity increases significantly as the propane diffusion selectivity decreases much more than that of ethane due to hindrance. From Figure 4, one can see that the proportion of the ligands plays a crucial role in maintaining an appropriate balance between the high selectivity and adsorption capacity of the gas molecules.

   Conclusions

  <p>
   In this work, the tpt ligand-inserted Mg-MOF-74 material was rationally designed from the molecular level using our computational approach, and the resulting structure was experimentally synthesized. The resulting reduction in the pore size led to significant enhancement in the ethane/propane separation selectivity. Despite the order of magnitude increase in the kinetic selectivity, resulting decrease in the pore volume was negligible, demonstrating that tunable design can break the traditional trade-off that one envisioned with respect to kinetic selectivity and adsorption capacity.
