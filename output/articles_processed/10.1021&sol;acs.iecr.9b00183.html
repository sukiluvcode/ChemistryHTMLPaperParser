   High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideDeveloping ethane-selective adsorbents is critical for efficient separation and purification of ethylene from the cracked gas, which is a great challenge in the petrochemical industry. Herein, a facile and robust MOF, MIL-53(Al)-FA, was prepared and investigated for its ethylene/ethane separation properties. Single-component ethylene and ethane isotherms of MIL-53(Al)-FA showed a higher ethane capacity than that of ethylene, with an ethane uptake of 3.7 mmol/g at 100 kPa and 1.2 mmol/g at 6.25 kPa (the proportion of ethane in the cracked gas) under 308 K. In addition, its IAST-predicted selectivity for an equimolar ethylene/ethane mixture was 1.9 at 100 kPa, while a dynamic selectivity of 1.8 could be achieved from breakthrough experiments. The mechanism for preferential adsorption of ethane over ethylene on MIL-53(Al)-FA was further revealed by molecular simulation. The average energies between the adsorbates and the sample were -10 kcal/mol and -8 kcal/mol for ethane and ethylene, respectively, resulting in preferential adsorption of ethane. Thus, MIL-53(Al)-FA is a promising material for efficient separation of ethane from ethylene.

  <h2>
   1. Introduction
  </h2>
  <p>
   As one of the most important industry commodities, ethylene is generally produced from hydrocracking of fossil fuels, along with a considerable amount of ethane. (1,2) However, closeness in molecular sizes and volatilities of the two molecules makes the separation an intrinsically formidable challenge. (3) The commercial technology is dictated by cryogenic distillation, which typically requires large columns with over 150 trays at 7-28 bar and 183-258 K, leading to extremely high energy consumption. (4,5) Hence, it is of urgent significance to exploit a cost-effective and energy-efficient technique for separating ethylene/ethane mixtures.
  </p>
  <p>
   Among current alternatives, adsorption-based separation using porous materials is an attractive candidate which can be operated under ambient conditions instead of high pressure and low temperature. (6) To achieve this goal, the adsorbent needs to be chosen or developed judiciously because it directly influences the separation efficiency. Over the past two decades, a staggering growing family of multifunctional materials, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), constructed by inorganic ion clusters bridging with organic linkers, have aroused intriguing prospects in various fields, especially selective adsorption and gas storage, including ethylene/ethane separation. (1,3,7,8) In view of their adsorption preference, the MOFs for ethylene/ethane separation were divided into two categories, ethylene-selective and ethane-selective. (9) Most of the reported MOFs were shown to be ethylene-selective adsorbents, whose separation mechanism was typically the interaction of ethylene with unsaturated metal sites (UMS) or π-complexation component. (10-13) Whereas, these ethylene-selective MOFs are not very ideal because they require a two-step process associated with ethylene capture and subsequent release. Additionally, the interaction between ethylene and UMS or π-complexation component is comparatively strong so that extra energy is required to complete the desorption process compared to physical adsorption. (10-13) In this regard, MOFs showing ethane preference are more energy-saving because high-purity ethylene can be directly acquired using one simple adsorption process. Furthermore, the application of ethane-selective MOFs would further reduce the adsorbent quantity needed for separation of the cracked gas in which C2H4 is the rich component, such as the cracked gas with the molar ratio of ethane and ethylene being about 1:15. (4) Consequently, developing ethane-selective MOFs is of great significance.
  </p>
  <p>
   In recent years, ethane-selective MOFs have attracted much attention, and some progress is being made. ZIF-7 and ZIF-9 with structural flexibility exhibited lower gate-opening pressure for ethane than ethylene, and their ethane uptakes were 1.8 and 2.4 mmol/g at ambient conditions, respectively. (14,15) MAF-49 was reported to show high IAST (ideal adsorbed solution theory, IAST) selectivity of 9 for ethane/ethylene as a result of its electronegative and electropositive functional groups, but its ethane capacity was only 1.6 mmol/g at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. (4) Ni(bdc)(ted)0.5 showed a high ethane uptake of 5.0 mmol/g and an ethane/ethylene selectivity of 1.8 at 100 kPa and 298 K. (16) Xia's group reported a few Fe-based MOFs prepared by one-pot synthesis or ligand substitution through an iron precursor, exhibiting high ethane amount of 3-5 mmol/g and good ethane/ethylene selectivity of 1.6-1.9 at ambient conditions. (17-19) Very recently, Fe2(O2)(dobdc) was reported to show a high ethane/ethylene IAST selectivity of 4.4, with a comparatively high ethane capacity of 3.3 mmol/g, which turns out to be the best-performing ethane-selective adsorbent among MOFs. (20) However, its poor stability and harsh synthesis conditions can severely hamper its industrial applications. For an industrial adsorbent material, its stability is considered to be the most important. In addition, it still needs to meet the requirements of excellent selectivity, high adsorption capacity, and relatively low cost, which is also being pursued by the research community. Al-based MOFs possess advantages of good stability and no environmental hazards. To date, only one Al-based MOF, MIL-53(Al)-BDC, was found to be ethane-selective with the capacity of 2.2 mmol/g and selectivity about 1.7 at 323 K and 1 bar, and its ethane capacity and selectivity were relatively low. (21) Therefore, effort should also be devoted to searching ethane-selective adsorbents with good separation performance and stability as well as low cost.
  </p>
  <p>
   Herein we developed an Al-based MOF, MIL-53(Al)-FA or A520, with ethane-selective adsorption characteristics for ethylene/ethane separation. MIL-53(Al)-FA is a commercially available analogue of MIL-53(Al)-BDC by replacing terephthalic acid with fumaric acid as the ligand. This compound shows good water-stability and can be produced at low cost and a large scale. Recently, it has been tested as the adsorbent for natural gas delivery for automotive vehicles, which is one of the very few MOFs promoted to industrial applications. (22) Therefore, it is worthy of exploiting for its capability for ethylene/ethane separation. In this work, MIL-53(Al)-FA was synthesized and then characterized. Ethane and ethylene isotherms were determined by a volumetric method. The isosteric heats of both gases on MIL-53(Al)-FA were calculated using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. Ethane/ethylene adsorption selectivity of MIL-53(Al)-FA was estimated by the IAST model. Fixed bed experiments were applied to mimic the dynamic performances of MIL-53(Al)-FA for separation of ethane/ethylene binary mixtures. The preferential adsorption mechanism of MIL-53(Al)-FA for ethane over ethylene was discussed with the help of molecular simulation.

   2. Materials and Methods
  </h2>
  <h2>
   2.1. Reagents and Solvents
  </h2>
  <p>
   All reagents were purchased commercially and employed as received. Aluminum sulfate octadecahydrate and ethanol were purchased from Guangzhou Chemical Reagents Factory. Fumaric acid was supplied by Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co. Ltd. Urea was supplied by Guangdong Guanghua Sci-Tech Co. Ltd. The high-purity gases employed for adsorption experiments were obtained from Zhuozheng Gas Co.. Ltd. (Guangzhou, China).
  </p>
  <h2>
   2.2. Preparation of MIL-53(Al)-FA
  </h2>
  <p>
   MIL-53(Al)-FA was prepared by using the optimized procedure reported by Alvarez. (23) Aluminum sulfate octadecahydrate (0.513 g), fumaric acid (0.179 g), and urea (0.092 g) were added into a 20 mL autoclave, followed by addition of 5 mL of H2O as the solvent. The slurry was stirred for 15 min at ambient conditions, heated to 383 K at a ramping rate of 0.15 K/min, and then held at this temperature for 32 h. After having been cooled to ambient temperature, the resultant crystalline powder was recovered by vacuum filtration and then washed thoroughly with water and ethanol to remove the remaining fumaric acid.
  </p>
  <h2>
   2.3. Characterization
  </h2>
  <p>
   PXRD (powder X-ray diffraction, PXRD) spectra were detected on a Bruker D8 ADVANCE X-ray diffractometer between a scanning range of 5°-40° at 5.0 deg/min. TGA (thermogravimetric analysis, TGA) measurements were performed on a Netzsch TG 209 F1 Libra apparatus, while temperature increased at a ramping rate of 10 K/min from ambient temperature to 873 K under a flowing nitrogen environment. Nitrogen isotherms at 77 K were obtained by using a Micromeritics ASAP 2460 analyzer to record the adsorption-desorption data. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) model was chosen to evaluate the specific surface area, while the HK method was conducted to acquire the micropore size distribution.
  </p>
  <h2>
   2.4. Ethylene and Ethane Adsorption Isotherm Measurement
  </h2>
  <p>
   Ethylene and ethane sorption isotherm measurements were performed on a Micromeritics 3Flex apparatus at varied temperatures and pressures up to 100 kPa. The specific temperatures during the adsorption process were precisely controlled by a temperature-regulated water bath. The free space of the adsorption environment was obtained by dosing pure helium gas before adsorption of target molecules. Approximately 0.1 g of material was fully activated under high vacuum at 423 K for 8 h before each sorption measurement.
  </p>
  <h2>
   2.5. Breakthrough Experiments
  </h2>
  <p>
   A self-assembly experimental setup was employed to evaluate the breakthrough performance of MIL-53(Al)-FA, as seen in Figure S1. Under the control of a mass flow meter, the velocity of binary mixture ethane/ethylene (1:15, v/v) was set to be 5 mL/min. A small-scale adsorption column was formed by packing about 0.4 g of activated sample into a long stainless hollow cylinder. The real-time concentration of the effluent component was supervised by mass chromatography (Hiden Analytical, England).
  </p>
  <h2>
   2.6. Simulation Details
  </h2>
  <p>
   The sorption module in Materials Studio was applied to calculate the energy distribution and density distribution of ethylene and ethane adsorbed on MIL-53(Al)-FA. (24) The structure of MIL-53(Al)-FA was built from the model proposed by Alvarez (a = 6.8419, b = 12.0877, c = 14.2007 Å, α = γ = 90°, β = 122.547°). (23) Because only physical adsorption occurs between the framework and the adsorbates, universal force field (UFF) was applied to describe their van der Waals interactions, while the Coulomb interactions were not considered. Since the structural flexibility of MIL-53(Al)-FA is nearly undetectable in adsorption experiments compared to MIL-53(Al)-BDC, it is reasonable to keep the framework of MIL-53(Al)-FA rigid in the simulation process. For the interaction energy distribution, one ethylene or ethane molecule was loaded into the structure via the Metropolis Monte Carlo method in the sorption module of Materials Studio 7.0, with 1 × 105 steps for equilibrium and production, respectively. To obtain the density distribution, the simulation method is the same as above, but both one ethylene and one ethane molecule were loaded into the frameworks.
  </p>
  <h2>
   3. Results and Discussion
  </h2>
  <h2>
   3.1. Characterization of MIL-53(Al)-FA
  </h2>
  <p>
   As shown in Figure 1a, MIL-53(Al)-FA is composed from corner-sharing aluminum octahedral connected by fumarate to form one-dimensional channels with the cross-section area of 5.7 × 6.0 Å2. (23)Figure 1b presents the PXRD pattern of the as-made sample, which matches well with simulated spectrum, confirming the high purity of the as-made compound.
  </p>
  <p>
   The porosity of the sample was derived from its nitrogen isotherm at 77 K. Figure 2 presents the adsorption isotherms. The isotherm was exhibited to be typical type I, from which a high BET surface area of 1160 m2/g and a total volume about 0.47 cm3/g were calculated. The inset in Figure 2 gives pore size distribution of the sample. The uniform pore distribution of ~7 Å allows the channel to adsorb both C2H6 and C2H4 molecules with negligible diffusion hindrance.
  </p>
  <p>
   Figure 3 and Figure 4 show the thermal and water stability of MIL-53(Al)-FA, respectively. The TGA result indicated two distinct weight loss steps. The sample began to dramatically lose the physically adsorbed water and ethanol molecules before 373 K and then remained at a steady state until a decomposition temperature of about 760 K. To test its stability under hydrothermal conditions, the as-made sample was exposed to hot water and saturated water vapor at 353 K for 3 days. The PXRD spectra after both conditions proved the well-retained crystallinity of the sample. The BET surface area shown in Figure S2 was 1132 m2/g and 1040 m2/g after hot water or vapor treatment, respectively, indicating the material can survive under hot water and lose a small portion of porosity under hot water vapor. Therefore, the good stability of this compound makes it very promising in real industrial applications.
  </p>
  <h2>
   3.2. Single-Component Isotherms of Ethylene and Ethane on MIL-53(Al)-FA
  </h2>
  <p>
   Single-component isotherms of ethane and ethylene were collected at 298, 308, and 313 K separately, as seen in Figure 5. MIL-53(Al)-FA showed higher ethane uptakes than ethylene under all observed conditions, indicating this compound interacts more strongly with ethane than ethylene. The saturated adsorption capacity of ethane was 3.7 mmol/g at 308 K and 100 kPa, moderately high among the ethane-selective MOFs (Table S1). As for the C2H6/C2H4 molar ratio of 1:15, the C2H6 capacity at low partial pressure (6.25%) should be considered. For MIL-53(Al)-FA, the ethane adsorbed amount was 1.2 mmol/g at 308 K and 6.25 kPa, higher than most of the reported MOFs except for MAF-49 and Fe2(O2)(dobdc) (Table S1), (4,11,14-21,25) suggesting this material holds promising potential for ethylene purification in an ethane-poverty situation. In addition, the ethane uptake was greatly enhanced compared to 2.6 mmol/g for MIL-53(Al)-BDC at 303 K and 100 kPa, because MIL-53(Al)-BDC with larger pore dimensions (8.5 × 8.5 Å2) shows weaker interaction with adsorbate than MIL-53(Al)-FA. (21)
  </p>
  <h2>
   3.3. IAST Selectivity of Ethane/Ethylene on MIL-53(Al)-FA
  </h2>
  <p>
   IAST is an efficient thermodynamic method to derive the adsorption selectivity of binary or multicomponent gaseous mixtures from individual equilibrium isotherms, which has been extensively utilized in adsorption-based separations. (26) To accurately describe the single-component adsorption behavior, the dual-site Langmuir-Freundlich (DSLF) equation, (27,28) assuming two different adsorption sites exist in one compound, was selected and written as follows(1)where p represents the pressure when the gas phase and adsorbed phase are in equilibrium; qs1 and qs2 represent the saturated capacity of each site; k1 and k2 refer to the affinity coefficients of each site; and t1 and t2 stand for the divergence from an ideal homogeneous surface, separately. The DSLF fitting parameters were given in Table S2 with high correlation coefficients of 0.9999.
  </p>
  <p>
   The IAST-predicted selectivity was shown in Figure 6 for the binary mixtures of ethane/ethylene with compositions of 1:1 and 1:15 at 308 K. For equimolar mixtures, the initial predicted selectivity was about 2.1 and then gradually decreased to 1.9 at 100 kPa, comparably high among the reported MOFs. Furthermore, the selectivity for 1:15 binary gas was slightly higher than that for equimolar mixtures. Though ethylene contributed to the majority of the gas phase, ethane was still preferentially adsorbed on MIL-53(Al)-FA.
  </p>
  <h2>
   3.4. Isosteric Heats of Ethane and Ethylene on MIL-53(Al)-FA
  </h2>
  <p>
   As for equilibrium separations, the interaction difference between adsorbents and individual components of gas mixtures is a significant factor that determines the separation performance. (29) Therefore, the isosteric heat of adsorption (ΔHs) was calculated to evaluate the adsorption affinity of each adsorbate on MIL-53(Al)-FA as well as the energetic homogeneity of the surfaces of the sample. Normally, ΔHs can be derived from the Clausius-Clapeyron equation (30)(2)where p stands for the bulk pressure, R stands for the gas constant, T refers to the absolute temperature, while C is a constant. As a result, ΔHs was obtained by multiplying the gas constant by the slopes from the plots of ln p versus 1/T of a given loading amount.
  </p>
  <p>
   Figure 7 gives the isosteric heat of ethane and ethylene on MIL-53(Al)-FA. It was observed that the isosteric heat decreased gradually with the surface coverage, implying that the surface adsorptive sites for both ethane and ethylene were energetic heterogeneous. The initial isosteric heat of ethane on MIL-53(Al)-FA was 34 kJ/mol and decreased slowly to about 29 kJ/mol when the loading amount reached 3.3 mmol/g. The moderate adsorption heat suggested only the van der Waals interaction exists between the framework and adsorbate. As for ethylene, the isosteric heat was between 30.5 and 27 kJ/mol, lower than that of ethane on the whole surface coverage. This is direct evidence that MIL-53(Al)-FA interacts more strongly with ethane than ethylene.
  </p>
  <h2>
   3.5. Simulated Interaction Energy and Adsorption Density Distribution
  </h2>
  <p>
   Computational simulation is an efficient way to investigate the intrinsic adsorption affinity, and therefore the energy distribution of both adsorbate molecules during adsorption in MIL-53(Al)-FA was calculated via the sorption module in Materials Studio. The energy distribution shown in Figure 8 was very concentrated for both ethylene and ethane, as a result of the uniform distribution of pores existing in the structure. The average energies between the gas and the adsorbent were -10 kcal/mol and -8 kcal/mol for ethane and ethylene, respectively. This discrepancy suggested MIL-53(Al)-FA is an ethane-preferable MOF, in good accordance with isosteric heat results. Similar adsorption behaviors were also observed in the mixture adsorption distribution (see Figure 9), where ethane molecules are more closely compacted in the pores compared to ethylene. For MIL-53(Al)-FA, the Al metal sites are fully occupied by six oxygen atoms, two from μ-OH groups and four from carboxylate linkers, and therefore the metal sites are almost blocked and failed to show strong interaction with the gas molecules (see Figure S3). Additionally, it is worth noting that the densest adsorption sites of ethylene are located in neighboring pores of ethane rather than in the same pores, suggesting that the separation mechanism of ethane/ethylene mixtures lies in the phase isolation of ethane and ethylene in the pores, which likely results from the stronger competition ability of ethane due to its greater interaction affinity with itself as well as the framework.
  </p>
  <h2>
   3.6. Breakthrough Experiment
  </h2>
  <p>
   Apart from the promising equilibrium performance, the dynamic breakthrough experiment toward the ethane/ethylene mixture is carried out to mimic the actual industrial circumstances. A small-scale adsorption column with 0.4 g of MIL-53(Al)-FA was packed to separate ethane/ethylene with a volume ratio of 1/15 at 308 K and 100 kPa. As shown in Figure 10, ethylene eluted faster on the fixed bed than ethane, indicating ethane showed stronger adsorption affinity than ethylene. The ethane and ethylene saturated uptakes on the fixed bed were 0.38 mmol/g and 3.18 mmol/g, respectively. Additionally, 99.95% ethylene productivity was 1.28 mmol/g for one breakthrough cycle. The calculated selectivity from the breakthrough curves is about 1.8, a little smaller than the IAST predicted selectivity. Therefore, a satisfied performance for trapping ethane from the ethane/ethylene mixture is achieved by using MIL-53(Al)-FA as an adsorbent.
  </p>
  <h2>
   4. Conclusion
  </h2>
  <p>
   A commercially available and chemically stable MOF, MIL-53(Al)-FA, was prepared, and then its performance on ethane/ethylene separation was evaluated. The isotherms under the tested temperature exhibit higher ethane uptake than ethylene, as well as higher ethane capacity on low partial pressure. The isosteric heat and the simulated energy distribution of ethane and ethylene confirmed the stronger interaction between the framework and ethane compared to ethylene. Besides, the adsorption density calculation revealed ethane molecules are more closely compacted in the pores compared to ethylene. The dynamic breakthrough experiment indicated this MOF can efficiently separate ethane from ethylene in the fixed bed packed with MIL-53(Al)-FA. Therefore, MIL-53(Al)-FA is a promising material for ethylene/ethane separation with a good balance on stability, cost, and performance.
