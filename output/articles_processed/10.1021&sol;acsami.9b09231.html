   Abstract
  </h2>
  <p>
   High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideThe pore size of adsorbents plays a vital role in determining the overall separation performance of gas separation and purification by adsorption. In this work, the pore apertures of the coordination pillared layer (CPL) was systematically controlled by adjusting the length of pillared ligands. We used pyrazine, 4,4′-bipyridine, and 1,2-di(4-pyridyl)-ethylene with increased length to synthesize CPL-1 (L = pyrazine), CPL-2 (L = 4,4′-bipyridine), and CPL-5 [L = 1,2-di(4-pyridyl)-ethylene], respectively. The aperture size of these CPLs varies from 4 to 11 Å: CPL-1 (4 × 6 Å2), CPL-2 (9 × 6 Å2), and CPL-5 (11 × 6 Å2). Among the three frameworks, CPL-2 exhibits the highest C2H2 uptake at ambient conditions as it has moderate pore size and porosity. However, CPL-1 has the best separation performance in the breakthrough experiments with binary gas mixture of C2H2/C2H4, thanks to the optimal pore size nearly excluding C2H4, which is only observed in the state-of-the-art UTSA-300a so far. The DFT calculations were carried out to elucidate the specific adsorption sites for both acetylene and ethylene among these frameworks. The modeling results suggest that binding strength is highly related to aperture size and that CPL-1 shows the highest adsorption selectivity owing to the optimal pore size. This work demonstrates that engineering pore size enables us to fabricate the highly efficient metal-organic framework (MOF)-based adsorbents for specific gas separation on the basis of the isoreticular chemistry.

   1. Introduction
  </h2>
  <p>
   Separation of acetylene from ethylene is an industrially essential but tough separation process. (1) Ethylene and acetylene are both widely used as basic feedstocks in the petrochemical industry. (2) The origin of ethylene derives from the fractional distillation of petroleum, tending to coexist with 1% acetylene. On account of the high activity of acetylene, a ppm level of acetylene can poison the catalyst during the Ziegler-Natta catalytic polymerization process using polymer-grade ethylene as starting material, and even explosion once compressed surpasses 0.2 MPa. (3) However, the commercial method for the removal of acetylene from the ethylene stream is cryogenic distillation, which requires both capital and energy input primarily because of the extremely low temperature and high pressure. It is necessary to develop such an efficient separation approach as pressure swing adsorption with relatively low energy consumption and favorable regeneration.
  </p>
  <p>
   Since metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) or porous coordination polymers (PCPs) were compounded in the last century, out of high designability and diverse available functionality, microporous MOFs for separation of molecule mixtures close in shape/size have been highly developed, making it promising to resolve this intractable industrial separation task. The challenges to achieving these desirable properties and functions are rational MOF design and facile synthesis. (4) For the microporous adsorbent, extensive studies have demonstrated emphatically that pore dimensions play an important role in the gas separation and purification by adsorption. By modifying and optimizing ligands, fine-tuned aperture sizes and unique functionality of MOFs can be devised for gas separations or storage. (3,5-11) For instance, Nugent et al. (7) elaborated three variants of SIFSIX-1-Cu with enlarged or shrunken pore sizes and demonstrated that rational pore size control can facilitate effective CO2 separation and capture. Similarly, Cui et al. (8) demonstrated that orderly assembly of acetylene molecules in the confined pore space could be realized in "SIFXSIX" materials by control over pore chemistry and pore size. By virtue of pore engineering, Lin et al. (9) targeted two isoreticular ethane-selective MOF materials for ethane/ethylene separation and found that the analogue with smaller pore size and more weakly polar pore surface could significantly strengthen binding affinity toward ethane. The Zhai group (12-14) methodically schemed a range of functionalized Zn-triazolate-dicarboxylate pillared-layer polymers and Zn-F-triazolate frameworks by tuning pore size and functionality for the higher selectivity of CO2/CH4 and C2 hydrocarbons over CH4.
  </p>
  <p>
   The coordination pillared-layer (CPL) structure is another platform framework first developed by Kitagawa et al.. (4,15-20) which was constructed with neutral 2D layers consisting of CuII and 2,3-pyrazinedicarboxylate (pzdc) and braced by multiple dipyridyl bridging ligands as pillars. This series of CPL-n has widely gained attention due to its simple synthetic procedure, high designability, regularity, and low-dimensional assemblies. (21,22) CPL-n has been extensively studied for gas storage and adsorption separations. (21,23-32) For instance, Chen and co-workers (26) reported a gate-opening effect on the adsorptive separation of propane over propylene in CPL-1. Similarly, Kishida et al. (29) reported selective adsorption of ethylene over ethane via a gas-induced structural transform in CPL-1. Moreover, CPL-1 was first reported to be able to strongly confine acetylene in the micropores, efficiently separating acetylene from the mixture gas containing carbon dioxide. (28) Additionally, CPL-2 (L = 4,4′-bipyridine), CPL-5 [L = 1,2-di(4-pyridyl)-ethylene], and other analogues have also been reported for carbon dioxide and methane storage and so forth. (33-40)
  </p>
  <p>
   The same as SIFSIX-type frameworks, the pore size, shape, and surface environment of CPLs can also be finely adjusted by replacing pillar ligands with different lengths. Herein, we engineered the pore size of CPLs by judicious selection of pillared ligands. We elaborate three ligands to construct isostructural CPL-1, CPL-2, and CPL-5 with increased pore aperture. Rational pore-size engineering can effectively hinder the larger C2H4 molecule (kinetic diameters of C2H2 and C2H4 are 3.3 and 4.2 Å, respectively (41)) from entering the pores, thus affording even higher C2H2/C2H4 selectivity than most top-performing MOF materials (3,7,8,41-46) including NOTT-300 and UTSA-100a.

   2. Experimental Methods
  </h2>
  <h2>
   2.1. Synthesis of [Cu2(pzdc)2(pyz) 2H2O]n (CPL-1) (pyz = Pyrazine)
  </h2>
  <p>
   The synthesis of CPL-1 followed the previously reported procedure with slight modification. (10) 2,3-Pyrazinedicarboxylic acid (H2pzdc) and NaOH were used instead of sodium 2,3-pyrazinedicarboxylate (Na2pzdc). A mixture solution containing H2pzdc (1 mmol, 0.1681 g) and NaOH (2 mmol, 0.08 g) dissolved in H2O (20 mL) was added to the aqueous solution (20 mL) containing Cu(ClO4)2 6H2O (1 mmol, 0.37 g) and pyz (12.5 mmol, 1.00 g) at room temperature. After stirring for 6 h, the precipitate was filtered and washed first with water followed by ethanol and then dried at room temperature. (11)

   2.2. Synthesis of [Cu2(pzdc)2(bpy) 4H2O]n (CPL-2) (bpy = 4,4′-Bipyridine)
  </h2>
  <p>
   Synthesis of CPL-2 followed the previously reported procedure. (34) A mixture solution containing H2pzdc (1 mmol, 0.1681 g), NaOH (2 mmol, 0.08 g), and bpy (0.5 mmol, 0.078 g) dissolved in EtOH:H2O (1:1, v:v, 20 mL) was added to the aqueous solution (20 mL) containing Cu(ClO4)2 6H2O (1 mmol, 0.37 g) at room temperature. After stirring for 24 h, the precipitate was filtered and washed first with water and then ethanol and dried at room temperature. (47)
  </p>
  <h2>
   2.3. Synthesis of [Cu2(pzdc)2(bpe) 5H2O]n (CPL-5) [bpe = trans-1,2-Bis(4-pyridyl)ethylene]
  </h2>
  <p>
   CPL-5 was prepared in the same way as described for CPL-2. (47)
  </p>
  <h2>
   2.4. Characterization
  </h2>
  <p>
   Powder X-ray diffraction patterns (PXRDs) of the samples were recorded with an X'Pert diffractometer (PANalytical Corp.. Netherlands) using Cu Kα (λ = 0.1543 nm) radiation at 40 kV from 3° to 60° (2θ angle range) at a step of 0.02° per second. The thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed in TA-Q500 (TA Instruments Corp.. USA) with heating rate of 10 °C/min under N2 circumstances from 50 to 800 °C. Adsorption-desorption isotherms of CO2 at 195 K were measured on a Micromeritics ASAP 2460 gas adsorption analyzer.
  </p>
  <h2>
   2.5. Adsorption and Breakthrough Experiments
  </h2>
  <p>
   The 120 mg sample of CPLs was degassed at 120 °C for 12 h under ultrahigh vacuum before each gas adsorption measurement. Single-component isotherms for both acetylene and ethylene at 273 and 298 K were measured up to 1 bar on a Micrometrics ASAP 2460 gas adsorption analyzer. Breakthrough tests were conducted in a stainless-steel column (50 mm × 4.6 mm ID) manually packed with the activated sample powder. The weight packed in the column was: 0.54 g of CPL-1, 0.41 g of CPL-2, and 0.38 g of CPL-5 samples, respectively. The binary mixture of C2H2/C2H4 (1:99, v/v) was introduced with a constant flow rate of 1.2 mL/min at 298 K. The outlet gas from the column was monitored using a GC2010 plus (SHIMADZU) gas chromatograph with a flame ionization detector (FID). After the breakthrough tests, the column was regenerated with a He gas flow at 120 °C for 2 days. Before breakthrough tests, CPL-1, CPL-2, and CPL-5 were initially activated as mentioned above overnight under ultrahigh vacuum. Then the breakthrough tests of mixed gas C2H2/C2H4 (50:50, v/v) were conducted on the packed bed of CPL-1, CPL-2, and CPL-5.

   2.6. Single-Component Adsorption Isotherm
  </h2>
  <p>
   The double-site Langmuir-Freundlich (DSLF) model is used to describe the gas adsorption isotherms. The model is well-defined aswhere P (kPa) is the pressure of the bulk gas at equilibrium with the adsorbed phase (kPa); A1 and A2 (mol/kg) are the saturated capacities of site 1 and site 2; b1 and b2 (1/kPa) are the affinity coefficients of the sites 1 and 2; N (mol/kg) is the gas uptake amount of an adsorbent; and c1 and c2 represent the deviations from an ideal homogeneous surface.
  </p>
  <h2>
   2.7. Density-Functional Theory Calculations
  </h2>
  <p>
   First-principles density-functional theory (DFT) calculations were implemented using the Castep code of the Material Studio package. (48,49) DFT-D was performed in the calculation to account for van der Waals interactions. (50) Calculations were carried out under Vanderbilt-type ultrasoft pseudopotentials and generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange correlation. A cutoff energy of 544 eV and an 8 × 2 × 4 k-point mesh were used to be sufficient for the fine energy convergence criteria (within 10-5 eV atom-1). The structure of CPLs and an isolated guest molecule were first optimized. Acetylene and ethylene gas molecules, respectively, were then placed at different locations of the channel pore, followed by a full structural relaxation. To compute the adsorbed molecule binding energy, one adsorbed gas molecule placed in a supercell (the same cell dimensions of CPL single-crystal structure) was also optimized as a reference. The static binding energy (at T = 0 K) between adsorbed gas molecules and CPLs was obtained using

   3. Results and Discussion
  </h2>
  <h2>
   3.1. Structure and Characterization
  </h2>
  <p>
   The synthesized CPL-1, CPL-2, and CPL-5 frameworks were confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction patterns (Figure S1) and thermogravimetric analysis (Figure S2) by comparing with the previous reports. (34,36,51) These results were found to be in good agreement with those in the literature. Actually, the crystal structures of synthesized CPLs have been previously described, (25,28,52) and their single-crystal structures reveal that this series has a two-dimensional sheet supported by pillar ligands, fabricating semirectangle channels that consist of four pzdc molecules and two pillar ligands (Figure 1a). The different sizes of pillars result in the varied size of channels in the range from 4 to 11 Å, and the fixed other width is 6 Å (CPL-1: 4 × 6 Å2, CPL-2: 9 × 6 Å2, CPL-5: 11 × 6 Å2). (47) The BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) surface area is calculated to be 414, 495, and 523 m2/g for CPL-1, CPL-2, and CPL-5, respectively, on the basis of the adsorption isotherms of CO2 at 195 K (Figure S3). The order of the BET surface area is consistent with the increased length of the pillar ligand, as expected in terms of a larger porosity. The experimental pore size distribution was estimated from the CO2 adsorption isotherms at 195 K according to the Horvath-Kawazoe model, revealing the obviously smaller pore size in CPL-1 than CPL-2 and CPL-5 (Figure S4).
  </p>
  <h2>
   3.2. Single-Component Adsorption Isotherms and Selectivity
  </h2>
  <p>
   The adsorption isotherms of C2H2 and C2H4 at 298 and 273 K up to 1 bar were measured among the three frameworks (Figure 2 and Figure S8). As expected, all frameworks were expected to have a higher affinity to acetylene, and CPL-2 displays the relatively highest C2H2 uptake of 3.13 mmol/g at 298 K and 1 bar, surpassing the uptake of 3.01 mmol/g and 2.07 mmol/g in CPL-5 and CPL-1, respectively. For CPL-1 (4 × 6 Å2), the acetylene uptake corresponds to the gas occupancy of one molecule per unit cell, while there are two molecules in the cases of CPL-2 (9 × 6 Å2) and CPL-5 (11 × 6 Å2) due to the larger pore space (Figure S11). As well, there is also a slight decrease in C2H4 uptake observed, while pore size decreases from 11 Å in CPL-5 down to 9 Å in CPL-2. Moreover, C2H4 uptake significantly declined as the pore size of CPL-1 narrowed further, nearly excluding C2H4 from the pore channel. It can be seen that the negligible amounts of C2H4 uptake in CPL-1 reach only 0.31 mmol/g at 1 bar and 298 K, giving an excellent uptake ratio of C2H2 over ethylene on CPL-1 (6.7), which is nearly quadruple that of CPL-2 (1.7) and CPL-5 (1.6) in virtue of low C2H4 uptake even though its C2H2 uptake is only two-thirds that of CPL-2 and CPL-5. Such molecular sieving of C2H4 from C2H2 has rarely been realized in most MOFs except the state-of-the-art UTSA-300a, (42) which shows less amount of C2H4 (0.04 mmol/g) under the same conditions.
  </p>
  <p>
   To further compare the separation performance of CPL-n with other top-performing MOF materials, IAST (ideal adsorbed solution theory) selectivity of acetylene over ethylene was predicted based on their single-component isotherms (Figure 2d). IAST selectivity was calculated with a C2H2/C2H4 mixture with ratio of 1:99 (v/v) at a total gas pressure of 1 bar and 298 K considering the composition of the gas mixture for industrial purification requirement. As seen in Figure 2d, CPL-1 (26.8) is expected to show much higher adsorption selectivity than CPL-2 (12.0) and CPL-5 (6.0) because of the size exclusion effect. Table S1 summarizes the IAST C2H2/C2H4 selectivity of the most top-performing MOFs reported so far. The hierarchy of adsorption selectivity follows the order: UTSA-300a > UTSA-200a > SIFSIX-2-Cu-i > CPL-1 > M′MOF-3a > CPL-2 > UTSA-100a > SIFSIX-1-Cu > SIFSIX-3-Zn > SIFSIX-2-Cu ≈ CPL-5 > Mg-MOF-74 ≈ NOTT-300. Among them, CPL-1 ranks only after benchmark UTSA series and SIFSIX-2-Cu-i, outperforming most well-known MOFs. (3,7,8,41-46) It is worth noting that CPL-1 shows significantly higher selectivity (100.93) than SIFSIX-2-Cu-i (44.54) at 273 K due to steeper adsorption isotherm at low pressure (Figure S9).
  </p>
  <p>
   The adsorption selectivity is highly related to the interaction between the gas molecule and frameworks, which could be reflected and explained by isosteric heat of adsorption (Qst). From single-component isotherms at different temperature, the experimental Qst at near-zero coverage of C2H2 in CPL-1 is estimated to be 40.2 kJ/mol (Figure S10), which is in agreement with the value 42.5 kJ/mol reported by Ryotaro et al. (28) This value is comparable with that obtained on the out-performer MOFs including SIFSIX-2-Cu-i (41.9 kJ/mol) and UTSA-200a (40.0 kJ/mol) and much lower than UTSA-300a (57.6 kJ/mol). The observation is identical to the prediction of IAST selectivity. Equally, the adsorption heat of C2H2 in CPL-1 is expected to be much higher than CPL-2 (30.8 kJ/mol) and CPL-5 (31.3 kJ/mol) because of the strongest confinement effect in the smallest channel.
  </p>
  <h2>
   3.3. Dynamic Breakthrough Experiments
  </h2>
  <p>
   Considering practical adsorption processes, we carried out dynamic breakthrough experiments to assess the capacity of CPL-n series for the C2H2/C2H4 separation. Figure 2e,f shows the breakthrough results of three frameworks with binary gas mixtures of C2H2/C2H4 (1:99 and 50:50, v/v, respectively) flowing over the fixed bed of adsorbent at 298 K. As expected, the ethylene was first to elute through the bed in each case. The hierarchy of dimensionless breakthrough time for the 1% C2H2 mixture was CPL-2 > CPL-1 > CPL-5 and for the 50/50 mixture was CPL-1 > CPL-2 ≈ CPL-5.
  </p>
  <p>
   Basically, a significantly superior performance is based on the ability for high separation selectivity and remarkable uptake capacity. (41) Unlike the selectivity analysis on adsorption isotherms, CPL-2 exhibits a higher acetylene capture ability, which results from the adsorption capacity at the low pressure (e.g.. <0.2 bar) as well as appropriate porosity. Theoretically, CPL-2 featuring the pore size of 9 × 6 Å2 is able to accommodate two acetylene molecules. Although there is a slight advantage in CPL-2 when applied to a very low content of C2H2 because of a higher adsorption capacity, the CPL-1 tested here exhibits the best performance among three sorbents due to its lowest ethylene uptake. It can be confirmed from the breakthrough curves when flowing the equimolecular gas mixture of C2H2/C2H4 where the longest retention time of C2H2 was observed in CPL-1 (Figure 2f). Although CPL-2 and CPL-5 uptake much more acetylene than CPL-1, the non-negligible C2H4 uptake in CPL-2 and CPL-5 will compete with C2H2 for the adsorption sites, thus reducing the accessible sites for C2H2 adsorption. Considering the regeneration and stability of these sorbents, cycle experiments were done with the same column. All sorbents were recognized to behave with an ascendant reuse ability (Figure S12). The result demonstrates a potential efficiency of CPL-1 for real industrial ethylene purification application.
  </p>
  <h2>
   3.4. Hydrothermal Stabilities of CPL-1
  </h2>
  <p>
   Among the CPL-n series examined, CPL-1 shows the most promising separation performance of acetylene removal from ethylene. For a real-world application, adsorbent candidates should satisfy the requirements of the excellent thermal and hydrothermal stability. From the thermogravimetric analysis, CPL-1 was thermally stable up to 491 K (Figure S2). CPL-1 reveals excellent structural stability, which could be evident by the PXRD patterns of samples exposed to air or soaked in water for 1 week at ambient conditions (Figure 3). The crystallinity of the air-exposed or water-soaked sample is retained from the PXRD patterns. Moreover, we performed water vapor sorption on CPL-1 to see whether it was highly stable against water. It can be found that unchanged C2H2 uptake was achieved on the treated CPL-1, which had been tested for water vapor adsorption (Figure S13). Figure 4 compares the C2H2 adsorption isotherms of CPL-1 at 298 K before and after soaking in water for 24 h or even 1 week. C2H2 adsorption capacities are almost fully retained in the CPL-1. These experiments all certify that CPL-1 has remarkable hydrothermal stability and shows great promise in the industrial application.
  </p>
  <h2>
   3.5. Density-Functional Theory Calculations
  </h2>
  <p>
   To get insight into the adsorption mechanism for C2H2 molecules in these materials, we performed detailed computational investigations using the first-principles DFT-D (dispersion-corrected density-functional theory) method. To achieve the most stable configuration of the adsorbate-adsorbent structure, several initial positions of adsorption molecules were performed using geometry optimization. The calculated results are in good agreement with the X-ray diffraction experiment (Figure S1). Additionally, it can be seen from Figure 5a that the distance of C-H O between one hydrogen atom of C2H2 and an oxygen atom of framework (2.21 Å) is much shorter than the sum of their van der Waals radii of hydrogen and oxygen atoms (2.6 Å), revealing that C-H O hydrogen bonds exist. The calculated result is well consistent with acetylene binding in CPL-1 reported by Kitagawa's group. (28)
  </p>
  <p>
   From adsorption isotherms, we found that the CPL-2 and CPL-5 can accommodate two symmetric C2H2 for each unit cell, in accordance with DFT calculation, and proved that a strong C-H O hydrogen bond (2.26 Å and 2.13 Å for CPL-2 and CPL-5, respectively) exists with the carboxyl oxygen as well. The shorter distance of C-H O in CPL-5 demonstrates stronger binding energy for C2H2. However, the binding oxygen between C-H O in CPL-2 is different from CPL-1 and CPL-5, and the distance of the carbonyl oxygen (2.26 Å) is much closer to the hydroxyl oxygen (2.86 Å). It worth noting that the hydrogen bonds between two C2H2 molecules are very weak (2.9 Å) in CPL-2, whereas there is almost no hydrogen bonding (3.2 Å) in CPL-5 due to the larger pore size. When accommodating C2H4, the evidently longer calculated distance of C-H O reveals that the hydrogen bonds are obviously weaker, which can account for the low uptake in C2H4 among the three materials.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, the optimized distribution of CPL-1 ⊃ C2H4 was obtained (Figure 5d), and the calculated ΔE for C2H2 is 56.2 kJ/mol, obviously higher than that of CPL-1 ⊃ C2H4, 42.0 kJ/mol, demonstrating the stronger adsorption ability of CPL-1 toward C2H2. CPL-2 and CPL-5 show different adsorption behaviors because of the different geometric arrangement of layered pillars compared to CPL-1. As the C2H2 molecular loading increases in CPL-5 and CPL-2, the calculated ΔE of C2H2 increases from 35.6 and 37.0 kJ/mol (one C2H2/unit cell) to 46.7 and 48.4 kJ/mol (two C2H2 molecules/unit cell), denoting the existence of "C2H2 clusters" inside the pore trap, contributing to a more energy-favorable configuration (Figure 5). The calculated value is reasonable despite it being slightly larger than the experimental Qst if taking the accuracy limitation of the DFT-D method into account. Based on the aforementioned discussions, it can be concluded that synergies of appropriate pore size and polar functional groups cooperatively enhance the interaction between C2H2 molecules and the CPLs.
  </p>
  <h2>
   4. Conclusion
  </h2>
  <p>
   In summary, we engineered the pore size of an important platform of MOFs, namely, CPL-n, through rational choice of pillar ligands with varied length. Herein, we put three isostructural frameworks including CPL-1, CPL-2, and CPL-5 into the separation of the acetylene/ethylene mixture. Fine tuning of pore size in CPL-n enables a molecular sieving of acetylene and ethylene, which is reported for the first time in CPL-n series for such an application. In virtue of the appropriate pore size, CPL-1 turned out to be an excellent adsorbent with high selectivity and outstanding separation performance originating from the exclusion effect toward C2H4, making CPL-1 outperform the most reported materials. This work demonstrated a method for pore size control in CPLs and proved to be a successful attempt to adjust the aperture size to achieve sieving. The DFT calculations elucidated the adsorption mechanism for C2H2 molecules in these materials, revealing the high adsorption interaction ability of CPL-1 toward C2H2 mainly because of the strong confinement effect in the optimally small pore size. This work may guide the excogitation of a new configuration or new adsorbent materials.
