   High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideThree new metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) based on hetero-O, N donor ligands, (Cu4I4)[Cu2(PDC)2DMF2]2 2DMF H2O (JLU-Liu15), (Cu4I4)[Cu3(CPNA)3(Dabco)0.5DMF3] 4DMF 4H2O (JLU-Liu16), and (Cu4I4)[Cu3(CPNA)3(H2O)0.5DMF3] 4DMF 4H2O (JLU-Liu17), (H2PDC = pyridine-3,5-dicarboxylic acid, H2CPNA = 5-(4′-carboxylphenyl) nicotinic acid, Dabco = 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane), have been solvothermally synthesized and structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses. JLU-Liu15 features a (3,4,4)-c sqc5588 net, whereas JLU-Liu16 and JLU-Liu17 are isostructural and possess a new (3,4,4)-c topology. All of these compounds are composed of the binodal inorganic Cu2(CO2)4 paddlewheel and Cu4I4 cluster secondary building units (SBUs). It is worthy to note that the linkage between two nearby Cu4I4 clusters in JLU-Liu16 is μ2-Dabco, which changed to a μ2-water molecule in JLU-Liu17. Furthermore, JLU-Liu15 exhibits high CO2 adsorption behaviors as well as I2 uptake and release features.

  <h2>
   Introduction
  </h2>
  <p>
   Over the past decades, the rational design and synthesis of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted great attention as functional materials due to their structural novelties and potential applications (gas adsorption, catalysis, luminescent, sensing, magnetism, etc.). (1-3) The design and synthesis of the crystalline materials with novel topologies and desired functions is still a great challenge. (4-7) To construct MOFs with novel structures can be considered from two aspects, ligand and metal. The ligands containing multidentate O and/or N donor often participate in the construction of diverse MOFs, (8-14) and the various metals can effectively facilitate the formation of secondary building units (SBUs), such as M2(CO2)4, (15) M3O(CO2)6, (16) M4O(CO2)6, (1) M6(μ3-O)4(μ3-OH)4(CO2)12, (17) and MxXyLz (X = Cl, Br, or I; L = N, S, or P). (18) Heterofunctional ligands can be easier to coordinate with numerous metal centers to form various types of SBUs. Recently, O'Keeffe and co-workers illustrated topological analysis of MOFs with polytopic linkers and/or multiple SBUs. (6)
  </p>
  <p>
   In another aspect, copper(I) halides with the formula CuxXyLz have attracted particular attention, (18) which can possess diverse geometrical configurations. (19-24) However, most of the reported compounds with copper(I) halides SBUs possess 0D, (25, 26) 1D, (27, 28) and 2D (29, 30) structures; only a few 3D frameworks exhibited adsorption, catalysis, photochemical and photophysical properties. (31-38) As mentioned above, many of the MOF structures are composed of one type of SBU. It seems that the combination of general SBUs with copper(I) halides to form the multiple SBU MOFs can lead to plenty of structures with diverse topologies.
  </p>
  <p>
   In recent years, iodine is one of the necessary microelements for human bodies, but radioactive iodine is harmful to humans and enriched in the nuclear energy arena. Recently, the release and adsorption behavior of iodine have attracted increasing attention, and MOFs are good candidates for the capture of I2. One of the famous MOFs, HKUST-1, has been applied to iodine sorption phenomena, because of an open-pored MOF containing coordinatively unsaturated metal centers. (39)
  </p>
  <p>
   We have been engaged in developing new MOFs structures these years and pursued their potential applications in gas adsorption/separation, sensing, and so on. (40-45) As a continuation of our previous work, herein, we utilized the ternary SBUs strategy to construct MOFs with two different kinds of inorganic SBUs (the classic Cu2(CO2)4 paddlewheel and Cu4I4 cluster). Most of the MOFs constructed with Cu4I4 clusters are not robust enough to investigate the gas adsorption property except for COZ-1 and Inof-8. (35, 46) The Cu2(CO2)4 paddlewheel and Cu4I4 cluster SBUs based MOFs are conducive to improve the stability of the structures and develop the gas adsorption property. Considering that the ligands may have great influence on the SBUs finally obtained, the hetero-O, N ligands pyridine-3,5-dicarboxylic acid (H2PDC) and 5-(4′-carboxylphenyl) nicotinic acid (H2CPNA) are employed (Scheme 1), in which the carboxylate group favored the formation of Cu2(CO2)4 paddlewheel units, while the pyridine facilitates the generation of Cu4I4 clusters. As expected, three novel MOFs based on ternary SBUs including the classical Cu2(CO2)4 paddlewheel unit, Cu4I4 tetramer unit, and organic SBU have been successfully constructed, namely, (Cu4I4)[Cu2(PDC)2DMF2]2 2DMF H2O (JLU-Liu15), (Cu4I4)[Cu3(CPNA)3(Dabco)0.5DMF3] 4DMF 4H2O (JLU-Liu16), and (Cu4I4)[Cu3(CPNA)3(H2O)0.5DMF3] 4DMF 4H2O (JLU-Liu17), (H2PDC = pyridine-3,5-dicarboxylic acid, H2CPNA = 5-(4′-carboxylphenyl) nicotinic acid, Dabco = 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane). Among these compounds, JLU-Liu15 exhibits the (3,4,4)-c sqc5588 net, whereas JLU-Liu16 and JLU-Liu17 are isostructural and both have the new topology with the (3,4,4)-c net. Unfortunately, only compound JLU-Liu15 is stable after the removal of the guest molecules, and it exhibits high CO2 adsorption behavior as well as I2 uptake and release features. Compounds JLU-Liu16 and JLU-Liu 17 are not stable in air or other organic solvents; when we try to remove the guest molecule, the frameworks collapsed.

  <p>
   The related chemicals and reagents were purchased from commercial sources and used without further purification. Infrared spectra were recorded on a Bruker IFS-66v/S FTIR spectrometer in the range of 400-4000 cm-1 using the KBr pellet. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data were collected on a Rigaku D-Max 2550 diffractometer working with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) over the 2θ range of 4-40° at room temperature. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were carried out with the TA Q500 thermogravimetric analyzer under a heating rate of 10 °C min-1 to 800 °C in air. Elemental analyses (C, H, and N) were carried out with a Vario MICRO elemental analyzer. Surface areas and pore size distributions were measured by N2 adsorption isotherms at 77 K with a Micrometrics ASAP 2040 instrument. CO2 adsorption isotherms were measured at 273 and 298 K with a Micrometrics ASAP 2010. The liquid state UV-vis spectra were recorded on a SHIMADZU UV-2450 UV-visible spectrophotometer.

   X-ray Crystallography
  </h2>
  <p>
   Single-crystal X-ray diffraction measurements were carried out on a Bruker Apex II CCD diffractometer for JLU-Liu15 and JLU-Liu17 and a Rigaku R-AXIS RAPID diffractometer for JLU-Liu16 with graphite monochromated Mo Kα (λ = 0.71073 Å) radiation at 293 K. Data processing was accomplished with the SAINT processing program. (47) The structures of these compounds were solved by direct method and refined on F2 by full-matrix least-squares with the SHELEX-97 program. (48) All the non-hydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic displacement parameters. The hydrogen atoms on the aromatic rings were located geometrically with isotropic thermal parameters of 1.2 times those of the attached carbon atoms. The void volume of these compounds can be obtained by the PLATON/SQUEEZE program, (49, 50) and the related topology analysis is obtained from the TOPOS software. (51) Formulas of these three compounds were designated from the crystallographic data combined with experimental ones (element analyses, TGA). Crystallographic data for JLU-Liu15-17 (1404803-1404805) have been deposited with the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre. Data can be obtained free of charge upon request at www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/data_request/cif. The summary of the crystallographic data and related parameters can be seen in Table 1, while the selective bond lengths and angles of these compounds are given in Tables S1 and S2 (Supporting Information).

   Results and Discussion
  </h2>
  <p>
   In the synthesis of these three compounds, CuI was used as the inorganic metal source which can be decomposed in situ to form both the copper paddlewheel and Cu4I4 cluster, thereby affording the binodal inorganic SBUs. Besides, in JLU-Liu15, Dabco was used merely as the structural directing agent to facilitate the formation of crystals. However, in JLU-Liu16, Dabco can be regarded as the bridging linker between two nearby Cu4I4 clusters. The coexistence of Cu+ and Cu2+ can be also certified by XPS measurements (Figure S11).

  <h2>
   Crystal Structure of JLU-Liu15
  </h2>
  <p>
   JLU-Liu15 crystallizes in the tetragonal space group P4/nmm, and the asymmetric unit consists of one crystallographic independent Cu(II) ion (Cu1), one Cu(I) ion (Cu2), half of one PDC2- anion, one I- anion (I1), and one terminal coordinated water molecule (O3). The Cu(I), Cu(II), and I1 atoms and the ligand are located on the crystallographically imposed 2-fold axis. The Cu(II) ion is five-coordinated with oxygen atoms with the average Cu-O bond distance of 2.667 Å, and two Cu(II) ions further form the binuclear Cu2(CO2)4 paddlewheel. The Cu(I) ion links to the I1 atom and forms the Cu4I4 cluster, which is further coordinated by the N atom from the ligand, with the average bond distance of 2.727(6) Å for Cu-I and 2.033(2) Å for Cu-N. In JLU-Liu15, the ligand PDC2- linked to two paddlewheels and one Cu4I4 cluster can be regarded as a 3-connected node, the paddlewheel unit can be thought of as a 4-connected square node, while the Cu4I4 cluster can be viewed as a 4-connected tetrahedral node (Figure 1). The 3D structure is formed by the linkage of two inorganic SBUs and the organic ligand. Notably, it contains one-dimensional channels with the diameter of 10.05 Å × 5.51 Å along the [100] direction (considering the van der Waals radii). A better insight into the framework can be provided by the topological analysis of TOPOS. JLU-Liu15 illustrated a ternary framework built of triangular, square, and tetrahedral nodes with an underlying (3,4,4)-c sqc5588 net, which can be found in the EPINET database; (52, 53) the point symbol is {62.82.102}2{62.84}{63}4. The void volume of JLU-Liu15 after removal of guest solvent molecules is ca. 56% by using PLATON/SQUEEZE.

  <h2>
   Crystal Structure of JLU-Liu16
  </h2>

   JLU-Liu16 crystallizes in the hexagonal space group P63/m, and the asymmetric unit consists of two independent Cu(I) ions (Cu1, Cu2), two independent Cu(II) ions (Cu3, Cu4), one CPNA2- ligand, two I- anions (I1, I2), one-third Dabco molecule coordinated to the Cu2 ion, and two terminal water molecules coordinated Cu(II) ions. Both of the Cu(II) ions with their terminal coordinated water molecules are located on the crystallographically imposed 2-fold axis, while the nitrogen atom (N2) from the Dabco and nearby Cu2 and I2 atoms are located on the crystallographically imposed 3-fold axis. The Cu1 and Cu2 coordinate with I1 and I2 to form a Cu4I4 cluster. In such a cluster, each Cu(I) or I- links three neighboring I- or Cu(I) to form a distorted cubane unit. Cu1 is tetrahedrally coordinated to three I- anions and one nitrogen atom from the CPNA2- ligand with an average bond distance of 2.548(1)-2.964(2) Å for Cu-I and 1.973(6) Å for Cu-N, while Cu2 is coordinated to three I- ions and one μ2-Dabco molecule with an average bond distance of 2.649(6) Å for Cu-I and 2.635(2) Å for Cu-N. The intracubane Cu-Cu distances are 2.571(2) and 2.987(2) Å; the latter is slightly longer than those found in other structurally characterized Cu4I4L4 compounds (L = monodentate nitrogen-containing ligand). The Cu3 and Cu4 can form the classical binuclear Cu2(CO2)4 paddlewheel where each Cu(II) ion is five-coordinated by four oxygen atoms from four CPNA2- ligands and one terminal coordinated water molecule. In JLU-Liu16, the Cu4I4 cluster and binuclear Cu2(CO2)4 paddlewheel can be both regarded as 4-connected nodes, while the CPNA2- ligand formed a 3-connected node which linked two binuclear Cu2(CO2)4 paddlewheels and one Cu4I4 cluster (Figure 2). Notably, the Cu4I4 clusters can be thought of as further connected by the μ2-Dabco molecule between them; such a linkage can be also found in previous reports. (34) The effective linkage of the CPNA2- ligand, Dabco, the Cu4I4 cluster, and binuclear Cu2(CO2)4 paddlewheel could afford a 3-D (3, 4, 4)-connected topology with the point symbol of {5.82}6{5.83.92}3{53.83}2. The void volume of JLU-Liu16 after the removal of guest solvent molecules is ca. 70% by using PLATON/SQUEEZE.

   Crystal Structure of JLU-Liu17
  </h2>
  <p>
   JLU-Liu17 crystallizes in the hexagonal space group P63/m, and it reveals a similar structure as JLU-Liu16, except that the Cu4I4 clusters are linked by the μ2-H2O instead of μ2-Dabco (Figures 2d and 3). The distances of Cu-I and Cu-O are 2.655-2.735 Å and 2.988(5) Å, respectively. The Cu4I4-O-Cu4I4 link configuration is really rare in the CuxIx hybrid materials, and only a few compounds with a Cu4I4-O-Cu4I4 dumbbell-like linkage have been reported. (54, 55) Such an arrangement endows the μ2-H2O molecule with an unprecedented linear coordination mode, while, in most cases, μ2-H2O bridges metal atoms with angles in the range of 70-152°. It should be pointed out that the 180 °Cu-O-Cu angle in the (Cu4I4)2O here is an uncommon fashion for the μ2-H2O bridge. The coordination water molecule is also confirmed by the charge balance and IR spectra (Figure S7). The void volume of JLU-Liu17 after the removal of guest solvent molecules is ca. 72% by using PLATON/SQUEEZE.

   Comparisons of the Ligands and Structures
  </h2>
  <p>
   It is well-known that the selecting of metal and ligand for the construction of MOFs plays a significant role on the structures obtained. In this work, JLU-Liu15 exhibits a (3,4,4)-c sqc5588 network by the assembly of H2PDC with the 4-connected square Cu2(CO2)4 paddlewheel and tetrahedral Cu4I4 SBUs, whereas, in JLU-Liu16 and JLU-Liu17, they both adopt the same new topology with the underlying (3,4,4)-c net. To verify that the selection of multiple O and N ligands is crucial in the synthesis of binodal MOFs as clarified here, two pure O including ligands with similar configurations, isophthalic acid and biphenyl-3,4′-dicarboxylic acid, were selected to react with CuI in the same conditions. However, only two previously reported topologies with copper paddlewheel SBUs can be obtained. (56, 57) It proved that the selecting of the ligand in this reaction system is critical and may help the construction of MOFs with diverse SBUs. Besides, the Dabco can just be regarded as the structural directing agent in JLU-Liu15, whereas it performed as a bridging ligand in JLU-Liu16. Interestingly, though the JLU-Liu16 and JLU-Liu17 possess the same topological structures, the linkage between the Cu4I4 clusters is different. As shown in Figure 3, in JLU-Liu16, two nearby Cu4I4 clusters can be easily bridged by the μ2-Dabco, whereas, in JLU-Liu17, the μ2-H2O adopts the rare linear configuration. The Cu-Cu distance between two Cu4I4 clusters changes slightly from 6.740 to 4.971 Å. Though great effort was made to introduce some other similar μ2 molecules, such as 4,4′-bipyridine, pyrazine, and ethane-1,2-diamine, into such a system, the results show that Dabco is especially useful here. A very clear insight into these three frameworks can be seen in Figure 4; these frameworks can be deconstructed into cages in which triangular moieties can be isolated from the frameworks. It is particularly interesting to see that the elongated ligand H2CPNA used in this work can lead to the formation of a Cu4I4-μ2Dabco-Cu4I4 or Cu4I4-μ2H2O-Cu4I4 linkage in the triangular moieties.

   Gas Adsorption Behaviors
  </h2>
  <p>
   Though JLU-Liu16 and JLU-Liu17 exhibit large void volumes, only JLU-Liu15 possesses moderate gas adsorption behavior among the three compounds. The frameworks of JLU-Liu16 and JLU-Liu17 collapsed after removal of guest molecules or activation at vacuum. The as-synthesized samples of JLU-Liu15 were solvent exchanged with methanol for about 3 days and activated for 10 h under room temperature for the gas adsorption studies. The porous properties of JLU-Liu15 were investigated by N2 adsorption measurement at 77 K. As shown in Figure 5, JLU-Liu15 exhibits a Type I nitrogen gas adsorption isotherm according to the IUPAC classification. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area was calculated to be ca. 762 m2 g-1, while the Langmuir surface area was ca. 1031 m2 g-1. To our knowledge, JLU-Liu15 exhibits the highest surface area among the MOFs or inorganic-organic materials based on Cu4I4 cluster SBUs. (35) The pore size distribution of JLU-Liu15 calculated by using a nonlocal density functional theory (NLDFT) method suggests a microporous feature with the pore size of about 0.6 nm, which corresponds with the one measured from the crystal structure. The CO2 and small hydrocarbons gas adsorption of JLU-Liu15 was also measured (273 and 298 K). At 273 K and 1 bar, the amount of CO2 uptake reaches 89.3 cm3 g-1 (ca. 3.99 mmol g-1). Such a value is higher than InOF-8 (66.2 cm3 g-1, 2.95 mmol g-1) reported by Hong's group, which is another binodal structure constructed by In3O(CO2)6 and Cu4I4 clusters. (46) To evaluate the affinity of JLU-Liu15 to CO2, the isosteric heat (Qst) was also calculated. At zero coverage, the Qst of CO2 shows the moderate value of ca. 30 kJ mol-1. The adsorption isotherms of CH4, C2H6, and C3H8 are also measured at 273 and 298 K under 1 bar, respectively. The maximum adsorption for CH4 is 39.5 and 27.3 cm3 g-1, that for C2H6 is 97.3 and 77.7 cm3 g-1, and that for C3H8 is 104.9 and 87.0 cm3 g-1, respectively. At zero loading, Qst of CH4, C2H6, and C3H8 adsorption is 23, 34, and 40 kJ mol-1, respectively, as estimated from the sorption isotherms at 273 and 298 K (Figures S12-S14).

  <p>
   The CO2/CH4 (50% and 50%, 5% and 95%) adsorption selectivity was calculated by ideal adsorption solution theory (IAST) based on the experimental single-component isotherms fitted by the dual site Langmuir Freundlich (DSLF) model at 298 K and 1 bar. The selectivity of CO2 over CH4 for JLU-Liu15 according to the experimental data is 3.05 and 3.1 (Figure S15). Furthermore, the selectivities of C2H6/CH4 and C3H8/CH4 are 27.8 and 461.5, respectively (Figure S15). It is highlighted that the high selectivity of C2H6/CH4 and C3H8/CH4 are much higher than many reported MOFs, such as JLU-Liu5, (43) JLU-Liu18, (58) and JLU-Liu 22. (59)

   Iodine Adsorption Experiments
  </h2>
  <p>
   Inspired by the iodine adsorption study of JLU-Liu14 reported by our group previously, (60) the iodine adsorption behavior of JLU-Liu15 was also investigated; it exhibits both higher I2 adsorption amount per unit and higher average release rate than JLU-Liu14. The samples of JLU-Liu15 were solvent exchanged by methanol for 24 h. Then, about 80 mg of the activated samples was soaked in the cyclohexane solution of I2 (0.01 M, 3 mL) in a sealed vial and kept at room temperature. As illustrated in Figure 6, the I2 adsorption process was accompanied by fading of the vial color from claret red to light pink after 72 h in a cyclohexane solution of I2 and reaches a total adsorption value of 3.65 I2 molecules per formula unit, while the I2 release process can be directly observed with a change of color to dark brown after 24 h with the samples immersed in ethanol. It is noteworthy that the uptakes of I2 being adsorbed per formula unit is higher than MOF {[Zn3(D-Llac)2(pybz)2] 3I2}n reported by Zeng's group (60) and JLU-Liu14 reported by us. (61) The release dynamic process can be observed by the UV-vis spectra, as shown in Figure 7. The release of I2 increases sharply and then gently, with an average rate of 1.82 × 10-6 mol L-1 min-1 according to the standard curve (Figure S5), which is faster than JLU-Liu14.

   Conclusion
  </h2>
  <p>
   In summary, on the basis of the hetero-O, N donor ligands pyridine-3,5-dicarboxylic acid and 5-(4′-carboxylphenyl) nicotinic acid, three new MOFs with ternary SBUs have been successfully constructed. JLU-Liu15 shows a (3,4,4)-c sqc5588 topology, whereas JLU-Liu16 and JLU-Liu17 adopt the same new topology with an underlying (3,4,4)-c net. Besides, Dabco was used as the structural directing agent in JLU-Liu15, whereas it can be regarded as the bridging ligand in JLU-Liu16. Furthermore, the structural difference between JLU-Liu16 and JLU-Liu17 is the bridging linkers between two nearby Cu4I4 clusters, which, in JLU-Liu16, is a μ2-Dabco molecule, whereas, in JLU-Liu17, it is a μ2-water molecule. The successful employment of diverse Cu2(CO2)4 paddlewheel and Cu4I4 cluster inorganic building units in these compounds reveals that the usage of hetero-O, N donor ligands could be a useful method to generate unique structures and topologies with multiple SBUs. Furthermore, JLU-Liu15 exhibits high gas adsorption behavior and I2 uptake and release features.
