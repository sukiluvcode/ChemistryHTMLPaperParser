   Abstract
  </h2>
  <p>
   High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideDue to the industrial requirements for high production and high quality of ethylene, efficient purification of ethylene from acetylene and ethane is of prime importance but challenging. Dynamic metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have demonstrated intriguing structural dynamics and diverse applications recently. Among them, although a few flexible ones have exhibited interesting ethylene purification capability, rigid ones were yet barely investigated for such purpose. In this regard, a cerium(III)-based MOF was solvothermally synthesized, which is rigid and assembled from rod molecular building blocks associated with coordinative N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) molecules. After liberating different degrees of DMF ligands via heating under vacuum or acetone exchange, both partially desolvated compounds of Ce-MOF-1 and Ce-MOF-2 were concertedly isolated in a fashion of single-crystal to single-crystal transformation. Although both newly generated materials crystallize in the same space group, they exhibit dissimilar unit cell parameters and slightly distinct ultramicropore sizes and pore microenvironments, thanks to the discrepancy in the desolvation degree. Consequently, Ce-MOF-1 and Ce-MOF-2 individually demonstrate C2H2- and C2H6-selective adsorption behavior, resulting in the potential tandem separation of C2H4 from C2H2 and C2H6 mixtures. The above results were successfully supported by not only single gas adsorption isotherms but also grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) calculation studies and dynamic breakthrough experiments. The present work may pave the way for rigid MOFs aiming at advancing applications via solid-state structural dynamics.

  <h2>
   Introduction
  </h2>
  <p>
   Ethylene is one of the most crucial industrial products, and its production is one of the important signs to evaluate the development level of national petrochemical industry. (1,2) Currently, stream cracking of naphtha and dehydrogenation of ethane are both main industrialized processes to obtain the ethylene product accompanied by two major impurities, i.e.. acetylene and ethane. (1) Owing to the strict requirements for the manufacture of high-quality chemicals that need high quality and purity of ethylene-starting olefins during industrial applications, efficient purifications of ethylene from acetylene and ethane are highly crucial. Nevertheless, these processes are highly formidable and challenging due to their similar molecular sizes and physical properties. (3,4) Considering that the conventional separation processes of high-pressure cryogenic distillation and partial hydrogenation by means of noble metal catalysts at high pressures and temperatures are highly energy- and capital-intensive, adsorptive separation processes of ethylene from acetylene and ethane are regarded as energy-efficient and practicable techniques. (5-8) Hence, it is highly desirable but challenging to synthesize and construct efficient adsorbents for preferentially selective adsorption of acetylene and ethane over ethylene.
  </p>
  <p>
   Emerging as a new class of porous materials, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have witnessed great success in the last two decades toward gas storage, separation, catalysis, etc. (9-13) Remarkably, reticular chemistry (11,14) of MOFs has played important roles in the binary separation of C2H2/C2H4 and C2H4/C2H6 by virtue of isoreticular and/or isostructural extension/contraction/expansion/functionalization approaches. (15-23) Very recently, a few groups have even reported that a single MOF material is capable of simultaneous removal of both C2H2 and C2H6 from a ternary mixture of C2H2/C2H4/C2H6 to enable C2H4 purification by a single-step process. (24-29) Additionally, Zaworotko and Chen et al. employed the synergistic sorbent separation technique to pack three task-specific MOFs in a fixed-bed column to empower high-purity C2H4 production from the aforementioned ternary mixture. (30)
  </p>
  <p>
   On the other hand, dynamic MOFs have gained great attention recently, thanks to their intriguing structural dynamics in a manner of single-crystal to single-crystal transformation under external stimuli (e.g.. pressure, temperature, light, and guest molecules) and diverse applications ranging from gas adsorption/separation to molecular sensing, drug release, etc. (31-49) Among them, a few flexible MOFs have revealed fascinating separation behaviors for C2H2/C2H4 and C2H6/C2H4 gas mixtures based on gate-opening effects. (50-55) In contrast, the host frameworks of most rigid MOFs seem invariable under external stimuli and the reported dynamic ones mostly focused on the elucidation of sophisticated structural transformations and preliminary sorption characterizations. (48,56,57) No reports have been made pertinent to ethylene purification.

  <p>
   Herein, a rigid cerium-based parent MOF of Ce-MOF-0 was originally isolated by means of a solvothermal reaction, which displays structural dynamics and is built from rod molecular building blocks (MBBs) binding to distinct coordination strength terminal N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) ligands, cross-linked by linear dicarboxylate linkers. Subsequently, two ultramicroporous daughter compounds of Ce-MOF-1 and Ce-MOF-2 were individually generated from Ce-MOF-0 upon distinguishing heat or acetone manipulation in a concerted fashion of single-crystal to single-crystal transformation. Due to the subtly distinct desolvation degree of both new materials concomitant with slight variations of coordination geometry of central metal and crystal lattice parameters, the less partially desolvated phase of Ce-MOF-1 exhibits C2H2 selective adsorption over C2H4 and C2H6, whereas more partially desolvated phase of Ce-MOF-2 exhibits unusual C2H6 selective adsorption over C2H4. These results are further confirmed by not only grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) calculations but also transient breakthrough experiments.

  <h2>
   Results and Discussion
  </h2>
  <p>
   The solvothermal reaction of (NH4)2Ce(NO3)6 and azobenzene-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid (H2ABDC) in DMF and in the presence of isonicotinic acid afforded the deep-orange crystals of Ce-MOF-0, formulated as [Ce2(ABDC)3(DMF)3] x(solvent), accompanying the reduction of CeIV to CeIII ions as proved by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and magnetic susceptibility measurements (Figures S1 and S2). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis reveals that Ce-MOF-0 crystallizes in the triclinic P1 space group. As shown in Figure S3, the asymmetric unit of Ce-MOF-0 contains two CeIII ions, one full and four half ABDC2- linkers, and three coordinated DMF molecules. Both of the crystallographic-independent CeIII ions are nine-coordinated and exhibit distorted monocapped square antiprismatic (i.e.. Ce1) and tricapped trigonal prismatic (i.e.. Ce2) coordination geometries, respectively. Ce1 is surrounded by nine oxygen atoms, one of which is provided by a coordinated DMF molecule (O14) and the remaining eight oxygen atoms are all derived from ABDC2- linkers, while Ce2 is ligated by nine oxygen atoms, two of which are provided by two coordinated DMF molecules (O13 and O15) and the other seven oxygen atoms are all derived from ABDC2- linkers (Figure S6 and Table 1). The neighboring CeIII ions are bridged by carboxylates to generate infinite [Ce4(O2C-)12(DMF)6]∞ MBBs extending along a direction, which are further cross-linked by fully deprotonated ABDC2- linkers via μ4-η1:η2:η1:η2, μ4-η1:η1:η1:η2, and μ4-η1:η1:η1:η1 coordination modes to produce a 3-periodic network with one-dimensional (1D) triangular-shaped channels of ca. 5.9 Å (Figure S8). Specifically, the distances of Ce-O (DMF) are distinct with respect to each other, indicative of different coordination strengths. Moreover, the distances of Ce-O (carboxylate) are in a wide range of 2.368-2.794 Å, which benefit the relaxation and rearrangement of the coordination geometry and preserve the crystallinity during structural transformation. Topologically, the [Ce4(O2C-)12(DMF)6]∞ MBB in Ce-MOF-0 is defined as a secondary building unit (SBU) consisting of a pair of opposite face-sharing square pyramids and monocapped trigonal prisms, while the ABDC2- linker is considered as a straight line, leading to a (6,6,6,6,6,7)-c net with transitivity 6 21 (Figure S9).

   Indeed, by directly heating Ce-MOF-0 at 60 °C under vacuum for 12 h, a single crystalline new phase of Ce-MOF-1 was obtained, formulated as [Ce4(ABDC)6(DMF)3] x(solvent) (Figure 1). SCXRD analysis reveals that Ce-MOF-1 crystallizes in the original triclinic P1 space group along with the variation of the unit cell, thanks to the differently partial departure of weakly coordinated DMF molecules from the parent compound of Ce-MOF-0. Unlike Ce-MOF-0, the asymmetric unit of Ce-MOF-1 consists of three nine-coordinated and one eight-coordinated CeIII ions, six ABDC2- linkers, and three coordinated DMF molecules, which implies two types of rearrangements of rod-shaped MBBs and is consistent with almost twice c-axis distance vs that of Ce-MOF-0. On the one hand, Ce1 and Ce2 are still nine-coordinated upon removal of two weakly bonding DMF molecules in Ce-MOF-0, which are further fulfilled by proximal carboxylates via chelation (from μ2-η1:η1 accompanied by the cleavage of the Ce1-O10a bond in Ce-MOF-0 and the formation of the Ce1-O10 bond in Ce-MOF-1) and μ3-η1:η2:η1 (from μ2-η1:η2) modes (i.e.. Ce1) and μ3-η1:η2:η1 (from μ2-η1:η2) mode (i.e.. Ce2), respectively, resulting in individually distorted tricapped trigonal prismatic and monocapped square antiprismatic coordination geometry (Figures S4 and S7). Subsequently, the first type of MBBs of [Ce4(O2C-)12(DMF)2]∞ is generated along the a-axis. On the other hand, Ce3 and Ce4 constitute the second type of MBBs of [Ce4(O2C-)12(DMF)4]∞ in the same direction. Ce3 and Ce4 are individually eight- and nine-coordinated and derived from Ce1 and Ce2 in part of Ce-MOF-0 accompanying the cleavage of the Ce1-O5 bond (i.e.. potentially generating open metal sites) and liberation of the weakly coordinated DMF molecule binding to Ce2. Ce3 and Ce4 exhibit distorted square antiprismatic and monocapped square antiprismatic coordination geometries, respectively. Nine-coordinated Ce4 is furnished by one of the carboxylates via μ3-η1:η2:η1 (from μ2-η1:η2) mode. Finally, two types of MBBs of [Ce4(O2C-)12(DMF)2]∞ and [Ce4(O2C-)12(DMF)4]∞ are cross-linked by ABDC2- linkers via μ4-η1:η2:η1:η2, μ5-η1:η1:η1:η2:η1, μ4-η1:η1:η1:η1, and μ3-η1:η1:η2 coordination modes to generate a 3-periodic framework. Due to the complex coordination modes of the organic building units, 1D triangular-shaped channels with slightly distinct sizes of ca. 5.8 and 6.2 Å are formed in Ce-MOF-1 (Figure S8). Considering that [Ce4(O2C-)12(DMF)2]∞ and [Ce4(O2C-)12(DMF)4]∞ MBBs in Ce-MOF-1 are defined as two similar SBUs consisting of a pair of opposite face-sharing trigonal prisms and monocapped trigonal prisms, the structure can be topologically classified as a more complicated (5,5,5,6,6,6,6,7,7,7,8,8)-c net with transitivity 12 38 (Figure S9).
  </p>
  <p>
   Interestingly, upon heating at 80 °C under vacuum for 12 h or soaking in acetone for 2 h (Figure 1), Ce-MOF-0 experienced a new single-crystal to single-crystal structural transformation to form another phase of Ce-MOF-2, formulated as [Ce2(ABDC)3(DMF)] x(solvent). Guest-free Ce-MOF-2 could also be readily produced by high vacuum at 30 °C for 12 h with the acetone-exchanged sample. Similarly, SCXRD reveals that Ce-MOF-2 crystallizes in the same P1 space group and there are crystallographically independent two CeIII ions, one full and four half ABDC2- linkers, and one coordinated DMF molecule in the asymmetric unit. However, the unit cell volume of Ce-MOF-2 is reduced by 14.4% due to the complete removal of two weakly binding DMF molecules during the transformation from Ce-MOF-0. There is only one type of MBB of [Ce4(O2C-)12(DMF)2]∞ present in Ce-MOF-2, which is converted from the MBB of [Ce4(O2C-)12(DMF)6]∞ in Ce-MOF-0 and similar to that of the first type of MBB in Ce-MOF-1. Ce1 and Ce2 are still nine-coordinated upon removal of two weakly bonding DMF molecules in Ce-MOF-0, which are further fulfilled by proximal carboxylates via μ2-η2:η1 (from μ2-η1:η1 without cleavage of Ce-O bond) and μ3-η1:η2:η1 (from μ2-η1:η2) modes, respectively. Subsequently, these MBBs of [Ce4(O2C-)12(DMF)2]∞ directing along the a-axis are cross-linked by ABDC2- linkers via μ4-η1:η2:η1:η2, μ5-η2:η1:η1:η2:η1, and μ4-η1:η1:η1:η1 coordination modes to engender a 3-periodic network along with 1D triangular-shaped channels of ca. 6.6 Å (Figures S5 and S8). Meanwhile, the [Ce4(O2C-)12(DMF)2]∞ MBB in Ce-MOF-2 is defined as an SBU consisting of a pair of opposite face-sharing trigonal prisms and monocapped trigonal prisms, resulting in the topological (5,6,6,6,7,8)-c network with transitivity 6 21, which is significantly different from Ce-MOF-0. Additionally, after immersing Ce-MOF-1 and Ce-MOF-2 in DMF, both samples could revert to original Ce-MOF-0, as confirmed by the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns (Figure S11), indicative of the reversible processes between the structural transformations.
  </p>
  <p>
   The solvent-accessible free volumes for Ce-MOF-1 and Ce-MOF-2 were estimated to be 39.2 and 41.8%, respectively, by summing voxels more than 1.2 Å away from the framework using PLATON software. (58) The PXRD studies were performed at ambient temperature for each compound after different treatments, and they are in good agreement with the corresponding calculated ones derived from the SCXRD data, indicating the successful occurrence of structural transformation processes and phase purity of each bulky sample (Figure S10). Next, to examine the permanent porosity of guest-free Ce-MOF-1 and Ce-MOF-2, nitrogen sorption experiments were performed at 77 K. As shown in Figure 2a, the result shows that both Ce-MOF-1 and Ce-MOF-2 possess typical type I isotherms with Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas of 474 and 883 m2 g-1, respectively. The pore size distributions based on N2 adsorption isotherms at 77 K show that both materials are truly ultramicroporous, and the main channel diameter of Ce-MOF-1 (ca. 6.2 Å) is somewhat smaller than that of Ce-MOF-2 (ca. 6.6 Å), which is well supported by the fact that the spatial distribution of more coordinative DMF molecules in Ce-MOF-1 contracts its triangular channel (Figure 2b).
  </p>
  <p>
   To examine the separation capability of both materials, a series of C2H6, C2H4, C2H2, and CO2 single-component equilibrium sorption isotherms for Ce-MOF-1 and Ce-MOF-2 were primarily measured at 273 and 298 K up to 1 bar. As shown in Figure 2c,d, the C2H2 adsorption capacity of Ce-MOF-1 is the highest among the four selected gases, whereas the C2H6 adsorption capacity of Ce-MOF-2 is higher than those of C2H4, C2H2 (e.g.. before 0.8 bar), and CO2. The results indicate that Ce-MOF-1 shows selective adsorption of C2H2, while Ce-MOF-2 shows selective adsorption of C2H6. Therefore, Ce-MOF-1 has the potential to separate binary C2H2/C2H4 and C2H2/CO2 mixtures. Nevertheless, Ce-MOF-2 may exhibit unusual C2H6/C2H4 separation, which is contrary to most C2H4-selective adsorbents and benefits C2H4 purification in one step. (24-29)
  </p>
  <p>
   To quantitatively illustrate the binding affinity of Ce-MOF-1 and Ce-MOF-2 with C2H6, C2H4, C2H2, and CO2, the coverage-dependent adsorption enthalpy (Qst) was calculated from variable-temperature gas adsorption isotherms by means of virial model fitting and the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. As shown in Figure 2e, the Qst values of Ce-MOF-1 at zero coverage are 32.09, 28.98, 34.20, and 30.28 kJ mol-1 for C2H6, C2H4, C2H2, and CO2, respectively, supporting its selective adsorption of C2H2. Meanwhile, the Qst values at zero coverage of Ce-MOF-2 are 26.26, 24.78, 26.73, and 22.12 kJ mol-1 for C2H6, C2H4, C2H2, and CO2, respectively (Figure 2f). The Qst value for C2H6 is slightly higher than that for C2H4 at zero coverage, indicative of a relatively stronger binding affinity of Ce-MOF-2 toward C2H6 with an "inverse" selective adsorption phenomenon. (59) To further authenticate such desirable and uncommon observation, GCMC simulations were performed to pinpoint the preferential binding of C2H6 over C2H4 within Ce-MOF-2. As shown in Figure S33, the calculated static binding energies for C2H6 and C2H4 are 28.0 and 25.6 kJ mol-1, respectively, which are basically consistent with our experimental values. The radial distribution functional g(r) plots of C2H6 and C2H4 molecules about Ce-MOF-2 atoms show that the adsorbed C2H6 and C2H4 molecules bind to the MOF framework through multiple adsorbent-adsorbate affinities, including weak C-H O (carboxylate) and C-H N (azo group) hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions, in which the larger intensity of C2H6 than that of C2H4 confirms the more efficient packing of C2H6 within the channels of Ce-MOF-2 (Figure S34). Consequently, the slight increase of channel size for Ce-MOF-2 (6.6 Å) compared with that for Ce-MOF-1 (6.2 Å) ensures the reversal of C2H6/C2H4 selectivity. Such phenomenon was also observed by a recent computational study and exemplified by MFM-300(In). (60,61)
  </p>
  <p>
   Motivated by the selective gas adsorption behavior and different gas adsorption affinities, the adsorption selectivities of corresponding mixtures were predicted for Ce-MOF-1 and Ce-MOF-2 on the basis of ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST). (62) As shown in Figure 3, IAST selectivities of Ce-MOF-1 for C2H2/C2H4 and C2H2/CO2 binary mixtures have been calculated at 298 K and 1 bar, which yield separation selectivity values of around 3.01 and 2.75 for 1:1 and 1:9 C2H2/C2H4 mixtures and around 5.03 and 4.66 for 1:1 and 2:1 C2H2/CO2 mixtures, respectively. The selectivity for equimolar C2H2/CO2 is even higher than that of some famous materials, e.g.. SNNU-45 (i.e.. 4) (63) and FJU-90a (i.e.. 4.3), (64) but still lower than that of top-performing MOFs, e.g.. BSF-3 (i.e.. 16.3), (65) UTSA-74a (i.e.. 9.0), (66) and DICRO-4-Ni-i (i.e.. 13.9), (67) under the same conditions. If we set the equimolar C2H2/C2H4 and C2H2/CO2 separations as concurrent objectives, the selectivity of Ce-MOF-1 for C2H4/C2H2 is still higher than that of some related MOFs such as BSF-1 (2.4) (65) and PCP-33 (2). (68) On the other hand, the adsorption selectivities of Ce-MOF-2 are determined to be around 1.55 for both C2H6/C2H4 mixtures (i.e.. 1:1 and 1:9) at 1 bar and 298 K. This value is also comparable to that of many presented MOFs for equimolar C2H6 relative to C2H4, such as ZIF-7 (1.5), (69) MIL-142A (1.51), (70) IRMOF-8 (1.6), (71) and MUF-15 (1.96), (72) but significantly lower than those of Fe2(O2)(dobdc) (4.4), (73) Cu(Qc)2 (3.4), (18) and MAF-49 (2.7). (71) Furthermore, the better C2H2-selective adsorption capability of Ce-MOF-1 and better C2H6-selective adsorption capability of Ce-MOF-2 were individually revealed by the comparison of separation potentials (Figure S37). (74)
  </p>
  <p>
   Finally, we further examined the practical separation performances of Ce-MOF-1 and Ce-MOF-2 at 298 K for C2H4 purification step by step and C2H2 separation from CO2. A series of practically relevant conditions were simulated for Ce-MOF-1 with 50:50 or 10:90 C2H2/C2H4 mixtures and 50:50 or 10:5 C2H2/CO2 mixtures at 298 K and 1 bar (Figure 4). The breakthrough curves show that whether for C2H2/C2H4 or C2H2/CO2 in different ratios, C2H4 and CO2 were first eluted through the packed column to produce the outflow of pure gas, while C2H2 remains in the packed column until a saturated adsorption capacity was reached and then eluted. In addition, to evaluate its recoverability, multiple dynamic breakthrough experiments of C2H2/C2H4 and C2H2/CO2 mixtures on Ce-MOF-1 were conducted, and the C2H2 retention time was basically the same as the first one. Notably, the regeneration of Ce-MOF-1 was achieved by purging helium or vacuum for 30 min under ambient conditions, which is consistent with mild adsorption affinity and proves its easy reusability for actual industrial applications. Considering the similar adsorption behavior of Ce-MOF-1 for C2H6 and C2H4, it can be reasonably speculated that Ce-MOF-1 can effectively remove C2H2 from the ternary mixture of C2H6/C2H4/C2H2 (Figures 3a and S36).
  </p>
  <p>
   Accordingly, dynamic breakthrough experiments for further C2H6/C2H4 separation were carried out under dry conditions, in which 10:90, 5:45, 25:25, and 5:5 C2H6/C2H4 mixtures were injected into a packed column of Ce-MOF-2 at different pressures and rates (Figure 5). Under ambient conditions, the breakthrough curves show that the mixture of C2H6 and C2H4 can be separated completely to realize one-step C2H4 purification without further desorption. As shown in Figure 5, C2H4 was first eluted without detectable C2H6 (below the detection limit of the thermal conductivity detector), while C2H6 with preferential adsorption retained in the packed column until reaching its saturated uptake and then eluted. For actual industrial applications, the ideal separation material should also have good recoverability. Therefore, we conducted three cyclic experiments under similar operating conditions through purging helium or vacuum regeneration for 30 min at room temperature, and the results showed that Ce-MOF-2 has quite good C2H6/C2H4 separation capacity without noticeable loss. Overall, different from the reported single-step C2H4 purification via a single MOF material, such tandem separation behavior of Ce-MOF-1 and Ce-MOF-2 derived from the same parent compound is expected to provide a feasible scheme for the efficient separation of C2H4 from C2H2 and C2H6 in the industry.

   Conclusions
  </h2>
  <p>
   In summary, a rigid cerium(III)-based rod MOF of Ce-MOF-0 was initially prepared by means of a solvothermal method. Due to the flexible coordination number of central metal ions and versatile coordination modes of carboxylates and the presence of weakly bonding DMF molecules, two daughter compounds, namely, Ce-MOF-1 and Ce-MOF-2, were concertedly and successfully isolated in a manner of single-crystal to single-crystal structural transformation upon differential temperature heating or acetone exchange. Thanks to the distinct degree of partial desolvation concomitant with variations of coordination geometry and unit cell parameters, both ultramicroporous Ce-MOF-1 and Ce-MOF-2 exhibit slightly different pore sizes and pore microenvironments, resulting in C2H2- and C2H6-selective adsorption materials, respectively. Collectively, both newly generated compounds derived from the same MOF would be capable of realizing tandem separation of C2H4 from C2H2 and C2H6, i.e.. killing two birds with one stone. The present work may shed light on the structural dynamics within rigid MOFs for advanced applications, e.g.. gas adsorption and separation.
