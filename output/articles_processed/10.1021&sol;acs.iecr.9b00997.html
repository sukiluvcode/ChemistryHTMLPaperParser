   High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideIn the chemical industry, it is significantly important but still a great challenge to achieve an efficient and energy-saving method for separating the ethane (C2H6)/ethylene (C2H4) binary mixture at ambient conditions. Adsorptive separation, as a promising alternative, can achieve C2H6/C2H4 separation with suitable high-performance adsorbents. In this study, we systematically investigated Ni-4PyC, a nickel-based MOF, for its interesting C2H6-selective adsorption behavior. At 298 K, the C2H6 adsorption capacity of Ni-4PyC was 3.84 mmol/g, which was higher than C2H4 (3.55 mmol/g). The adsorptive selectivity toward the C2H6/C2H4 (1:15, v/v) mixture was calculated to be 1.7. The molecular simulation showed that both the pore effect and hydrogen bonding governed the C2H6-selective adsorption behavior. Moreover, cyclic breakthrough experiments further confirmed the dynamic separation performance and excellent recyclability, during which no obvious change was observed for the breakthrough time of the two components. Therefore, as a C2H6-selective adsorbent with excellent cycle performance, Ni-4PyC exhibited relatively high adsorption capacity and moderate selectivity, making it a competitive candidate for further application in separating the cracking gas of the C2H6/C2H4 mixture.

  <h2>
   1. Introduction
  </h2>
  <p>
   As one of the most widely used chemical materials, C2H4 is the necessary intermediate to manufacture many polymers and chemical products. (1) In the chemical industry, C2H6 is generally used to produce C2H4 by thermal decomposition or steam cracking. (2) However, such a process is incomplete and thus ~5-9% unreacted C2H6 exists in the C2H4 product as undesired impurity. (3) Hence, it is of vital importance to separate the C2H6/C2H4 (1:15, v/v) (4-6) to obtain pure C2H4 for further utilization. Owing to the similarities of C2H6 (boiling point 184.5 K and kinetic diameter 4.443 Å) and C2H4 (boiling point 169.4 K and kinetic diameter 4.163 Å) molecules in physicochemical properties, (7,8) such separation primarily relies on the cryogenic distillation technology, which involves in the phase change. Typically, the separation of C2H6/C2H4 is carried out in the distillation tower with more than 100 trays under the conditions of 248 K and 23 bar together. (9) Therefore, if such a process could be achieved with high efficiency under more mild conditions, huge energy and capital input could be saved. (2) Compared with the traditional cryogenic distillation, adsorptive separation is widely recognized as a promising alternative due to its low cost and operational simplicity. (10)
  </p>
  <p>
   In the field of adsorptive separation, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted ever-rising attention as a new class of porous adsorbents. Compared with other traditional adsorbents, the large specific surface areas together with the tunability in pore structures and functionalities have made MOFs highly competitive in small gas molecule adsorption and separation (11-16) as well as the separation of the C2H6/C2H4 binary mixture. (17-21)
  </p>
  <p>
   Most MOFs achieve the separation through the preferential adsorption of C2H4 over C2H6, where the open metal sites (OMSs) play a significant role in MOFs. (18,22,23) The loading of transition metals such as Cu(I) or Ag(I) ions will largely enhance the π-complexation interactions between the framework and the unsaturated C2H4 molecules, (24-28) as a result, further improving the C2H4-selective adsorption performance. However, enhanced interactions between the metal sites and C2H4 molecules would make it harder to desorb, which increases not only the energy consumption but also the possibility of olefin polymerization during the desorption steps. (29,30) More importantly, the desired polymer-grade ( > 99.95%) C2H4 product is only obtained with at least four cycles of adsorption-desorption operations, (3) during which additional heating or vacuum operation is also required. Hence, C2H4-selective MOFs might not be an optimal choice for separating the C2H4/C2H6 binary mixture. On the contrary, C2H6-selective MOFs would be a better alternative to solve the problem. As mentioned above, the undesired impurity C2H6 makes up only a small part of the C2H6/C2H4 cracking gas mixture ( ~ 5-9%). If C2H6-selective MOFs were applied, compared with C2H4-selective adsorbents, the separation could be realized by a simple one-step adsorption process, (31,32) which could reduce the energy consumption by approximately 40% when using the pressure swing adsorption (PSA) technology. (2,33) Therefore, development of high-performance C2H6-selective MOFs is highly desired.
  </p>
  <p>
   Currently, there are some strategies to achieve C2H6-selective adsorption on MOFs. Gücüyener and his co-workers (34) reported the first C2H6-selective MOF, ZIF-7, in which C2H6 preferential adsorption was realized by the guest-induced structural transformation (or the gate-opening behavior). Strong interactions between C2H6 molecules and the benzimidazole ligands could lead to the structural change at lower pressure. After the gate-opening behavior, at 298 K the uptake of C2H6 sharply increased and reached 1.83 mmol/g. MAF-49, (3) as another landmark of a C2H6-selective MOF, exhibited high adsorption selectivity toward the C2H6/C2H4 mixture. It could be ascribed to the rich electronegative nitrogen atoms in the pore surface that could form more hydrogen bonds with C2H6 than C2H4. At 298 K, the C2H6/C2H4 selectivity of MAF-49 was 2.7 and C2H6 adsorption capacity was 1.73 mmol/g. Moreover, by reducing the amount of polar binding sites in MOFs, Lin et al. (35) reported Cu(Qc)2, in which the inert pore environment with the self-adaptive pore structure of the framework maximized the adsorption affinity toward C2H6 over C2H4. At 298 K and a pressure of 100 kPa, the adsorption capacity of Cu(Qc)2 was 1.85 mmol/g and the selectivity was 3.4. Li et al. (36) employed postsynthetic modification strategy successfully and oxidized Fe(II) open sites of Fe2(dobdc) into Fe-peroxo sites. The modified Fe-peroxo sites are highly electronegative and are inclined to form stronger hydrogen bonds with the C2H6 molecules, which lead to the reversed C2H6/C2H4 adsorption behavior. Our previous study on the C2H6-selective MOF, PCN-250, indicates that C2H6 molecules mainly distributed around the nitrogen atoms of ligands, where the pore size effect and different van der Waals interactions lead to the C2H6-selective adsorption behavior. Therefore, among all these strategies together with our previous work (4,37) suggest that the introduction of highly electronegative atoms (N, F, etc.) into the framework with appropriate pore structures would be a more facile way to achieve C2H6 preferential adsorption.
  </p>
  <p>
   In this study, we systematically investigated a nickel-based MOF (38) and its C2H6-selective adsorption behavior. The structure of Ni-4PyC consists of two different dimeric nickel clusters with isonicotinic acid (4-PyC) ligands. The framework is comprised of two kinds of pores (see Figure S1), and the pore passages are decorated with N atoms from the ligands. Static adsorption isotherms indicate that, compared to the uptakes of C2H4, Ni-4PyC has a larger C2H6 adsorption capacity. The adsorption selectivity on Ni-4PyC ( ~ 1.7) was predicted using the ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST), (39,40) and the heat of adsorption was calculated using the virial equation. (32) Molecular simulation was adopted to investigate the adsorptive separation behavior of Ni-4PyC. Cyclic breakthrough experiments toward the C2H6/C2H4 (1:15, v/v) binary mixture further confirmed its excellent dynamic separation performance and good reusability.

  </h2>
  <h2>
   2.1. Materials
  </h2>
  <p>
   Isonicotinic acid (4-PyC) was supplied by J&amp;K Scientific Co.. Ltd. (Beijing, China). Nickel(II) carbonate anhydrous (NiCO3, 98%) was purchased from Alfa Aesar (China) Chemicals Co.. Ltd. Methanol (MeOH, 99.5%) together with tetrahydrofuran (THF, 99.8%) were bought from Guangdong Guanghua Sci-Tech Co.. Ltd. Reagents and chemicals were all used directly after receiving.
  </p>
  <h2>
   2.2. Characterization
  </h2>
  <p>
   The results of powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) were obtained through a Bruker D8 Advanced X-ray diffractometer (Cu Kα, 40 kV and 40 mA) at 5-50°, and the obtained data were further processed using MDI Jade software. The crystal morphology was observed using a Hitachi SU-8220 field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM,) after gold deposition under vacuum. The nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherm was obtained from a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 instrument at 77 K. The BET equation was applied to calculate the pore texture properties, and the pore size distribution was calculated using the density functional theory (DFT) method. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) data was collected under a nitrogen atmosphere on a TA Q500 TGA instrument from 308 to 873.15 K, and the heating rate was fixed at 5 K/min.
  </p>
  <h2>
   2.3. Adsorption Measurement
  </h2>
  <p>
   Pure component adsorption isotherms were obtained at 278, 288, and 298 K through a 3Flex surface characterization analyzer (Micromeritics). Before the experiment, about 100 mg of activated Ni-4PyC was transferred into a sample tube and heated under vacuum for 10 h at 423 K. C2H6 and C2H4 gases were used in ultrahigh purity grade (99.99%) during the adsorption experiments.
  </p>
  <h2>
   2.4. Breakthrough Experiments
  </h2>
  <p>
   The dynamic separation performance of Ni-4PyC toward the C2H6/C2H4 (1:15, v/v) mixture was conducted using a homemade breakthrough experiment system (Scheme S1) at 298 K. Prior to the breakthrough experiment, about 200 mg of the activated Ni-4PyC sample was loaded into an adsorption column (4 mm × 100 mm i.d. and 280 mm in length), the glass wool was used to plug the two ends of the column, and the adsorption column was made by stainless steel. The column was pretreated by heating to 423 K for 60 min with a helium flow (10 mL/min) to release the adsorbed gas impurities. After cooling to room temperature, the adsorption column was put into a temperature-controlled oven and kept at 298 K. The binary mixture of C2H6/C2H4 was passed through the column at a flow rate of 2 mL/min, controlled through the mass flowmeter. Gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector was applied to detect the gas flow from the end of the adsorption column. To calibrate dead volume (the space that gas mixture need to travel before reaching the gas chromatography) of the system, C2H6/C2H4 (1/15, v/v) mixture flowed into the system at 2 mL/min, in which an empty adsorption column with the same size was used. After the blank residence time was obtained, the system was cleaned with a helium flow (10 mL/min). The blank breakthrough experiment was conducted under similar conditions to the actual breakthrough experiments. In this work, all the breakthrough curves are presented after the correction of blank residence time.
  </p>
  <h2>
   2.5. Models and Methods in Simulation
  </h2>
  <p>
   We obtained and used the Ni-4PyC's atomic structure parameters according to the literature reports (38) after removing solvent molecules. Table S1 showed the Lennard-Jones (LJ) parameters of atoms in Ni-4PyC, which were acquired using the universal force field (UFF). (41) As for the two gas molecules (C2H4 and C2H6), the parameters came from the united-atom model with the TraPPE force field. (42) The general UFF was well predicted and described for the gas adsorption behavior of the various MOFs, (43-47) including the MOF-alkane pairs. (48,49) We calculated cross interactions by the Lorentz-Berthelot combining rules.
  </p>
  <p>
   The pure component C2H6 and C2H4 gases being adsorbed into the framework of Ni-4PyC was simulated using the GCMC method. In this work, the RASPA package was adopted in all the GCMC simulations. (50) The structure of Ni-4PyC was assumed to be rigid. LJ interactions were calculated with a cutoff of 12.0 Å, and the simulation cells were replicated to at least 24 Å along the x, y, and z dimensions with periodic boundary conditions. In our work, the total cycles of simulation are 200 000 and first 100 000 cycles of the simulation are for the equilibration while the final 100 000 cycles of the simulation are for the ensemble averages. There exists N trial moves (N, the number of gas molecules) in each cycle, including translation, rotation, regrowth, and swap (insertion and deletion). Further increasing the cycle number has no obvious effect on the results of simulation. The interactions at 298 K between C2H4 and C2H6 with the framework were calculated with the Forcite module in Materials Studio software.

   3. Results and Discussion
  </h2>
  <h2>
   3.1. Characterization of Ni-4PyC
  </h2>
  <p>
   The results of Ni-4PyC samples' PXRD patterns are shown in Figure 1. All the experimentally measured characteristic peaks agree well with the simulated one, indicating the high phase purity of these samples. Besides, the sharp and intense diffraction peaks of the activated samples suggest that the structure of the framework was well preserved during the solvent-exchange and degassing process.
  </p>
  <p>
   To obtain the crystal size and morphology of Ni-4PyC, high-resolution SEM images of Ni-4PyC crystals are shown in Figure 2. It can be observed that highly crystallized Ni-4PyC particles tend to gather into clusters. Figure 2b presents that the Ni-4PyC crystal possesses a spindle-shaped morphology, and the enlarged picture shows that the spindle-shaped crystal with an average length of 3 and 1 μm in width.
  </p>
  <p>
   The pore texture and surface area of Ni-4PyC was confirmed by the nitrogen adsorption isotherm at 77 K. The isotherms in Figure S2 are identified as type I isotherms, revealing the microporous nature of Ni-4PyC. The BET surface area of Ni-4PyC was calculated to be 943 m2/g, which was in good accordance with the literature reported value 945 m2/g. (38) The total pore volume of Ni-4PyC was 0.382 cm3/g, most of which was the micropore (0.326 cm3/g). The inset of Figure S2 indicates that the pore size distribution of Ni-4PyC is around 5-9 Å, which again confirmed its microporous structure.
  </p>
  <p>
   The thermal stability of Ni-4PyC was confirmed by TGA measurement. As shown in Figure S3, the weight loss consists of three steps: the first step below 423.15 K is due to the volatilization of residual solvent molecules (THF, MeOH, and H2O). The second step appears between 473.15 and 523.15 K mainly because of the deprivation of the bridging water molecules, which are crucial for holding the framework together. (38) The final step of weight loss starting from 573.15 K is due to the decomposition of the 4-PyC ligand, which leads to the framework collapse.
  </p>
  <h2>
   3.2. Adsorption Isotherms of C2H4 and C2H6 on Ni-4PyC
  </h2>
  <p>
   Figure 3a-c presents the experimentally measured adsorption isotherms for C2H6 and C2H4 at different temperatures (278, 288, and 298 K). The uptakes of C2H6 and C2H4 decreased as temperature increased, exhibiting a thermodynamically controlled typical physisorption process. Compared with the uptake of C2H4, Ni-4PyC exhibits higher C2H6 adsorption capacities at experimental temperatures. To compare with other C2H6-selective MOFs, we have listed the adsorption capacities of some C2H6-selective adsorbents in Table S2. To our delight, the C2H6 adsorption capacity of Ni-4PyC (3.84 mmol/g) is obviously higher than those some reported MOFs, for instance, MAF-49 (1.73 mmol/g), (3) ZIF-7 (1.83 mmol/g), (34) Cu(Qc)2 (1.85 mmol/g), (35) IRMOF-8 (3.6 mmol/g) (32) and comparable to MIL-142A (3.8 mmol/g), (5) while relatively lower than Ni(bdc)(ted)0.5 (4.8 mmol/g) (37) or PCN-250 (5.2 mmol/g). (4)
  </p>
  <h2>
   3.3. Isosteric Heats of Adsorption
  </h2>
  <p>
   To evaluate the adsorption affinities between the two gas molecules and the framework, the virial equation was adopted to evaluate the isosteric heat of adsorption (Qst) for C2H6 and C2H4, respectively. The fitting parameters and virial fitting lines of C2H6 and C2H4 are presented in Table S3 and Figures S4 and S5, respectively. As depicted in Figure 3d, at zero coverage, the Qst value is 29.07 kJ/mol for C2H6 and 27.32 kJ/mol for C2H4. Moreover, during the entire adsorption process, the Qst value for C2H6 (29.07-32.39 kJ/mol) was higher than that of C2H4 (27.32-30.03 kJ/mol), indicating that the framework of Ni-4PyC had much stronger interactions with C2H6. Therefore, C2H6 was preferentially adsorbed into Ni-4PyC, leading to the C2H6-selective adsorption behavior, and a detailed reason will be discussed using molecular simulation in the next section.
  </p>
  <h2>
   3.4. Simulation Study of C2H6 and C2H4 Adsorption Behavior
  </h2>
  <p>
   Molecular simulation was employed to cast light on the adsorption process toward the two gas molecules. Figure S6 shows the trends of simulated isotherms of two gases that are in agreement with the experimental obtained data. However, in both the simulation and experiment, the adsorbed amounts of C2H6 and C2H4 become closer and closer at higher pressure; in other words, the separation performance of Ni-4PyC is better when the pressure is below 40 kPa.
  </p>
  <p>
   To further understand the separation mechanism of two gases, Figure 4 presents, respectively, three pairs of overlapping snapshots of C2H6 (Figure 4d-f) and C2H4 (Figure 4a-c) molecules being adsorbed in Ni-4PyC at different pressures (1.39, 18.46, and 57.16 kPa). It can be seen that the adsorbed C2H6 and C2H4 molecules mainly distribute around the nitrogen atoms from the pyridine ligands in both of the two types of pores, which are labeled as Pore I and Pore II (Figure S1). For Ni-4PyC, typically, there are two ways of interaction of gas molecules and pyridine ligands. The pyridine ligands around Pore I tend to capture the same amount of C2H6 and C2H4 at 1.39 kPa, for the binding energies are very close between the framework and two gas molecules (-20.79 kJ/mol for C2H4, -21.14 kJ/mol for C2H6). Besides, the uptake of two gas molecules slightly increases with increasing of pressure, indicating that the Pore I almost reaches the adsorption saturation at very low pressure. For pore II, a handful of C2H4 molecules are adsorbed at 1.39 kPa, due to the weaker binding energy between the C2H4 molecule and the pore wall (-19.47 kJ/mol). On the contrary, more C2H6 molecules could enter into Pore II at the same pressure due to the larger molecular size that leads to the stronger binding energy with Pore II (-23.59 kJ/mol). In Pore II, the proportion of hydrogen-bonding energy for C2H4 makes up for about ~42.2% of total binding energy, while for C2H6, this value has risen up to 67.3%, indicating that the difference of hydrogen-bonding energies between C2H4 and C2H6 with the framework is a main reason for the high selectivity in the low-pressure range. However, as the pressure gradually rises to 57.16 kPa or the higher-pressure range, relatively more C2H4 molecules with smaller steric hindrance are adsorbed into both Pore II and Pore I, which in turn reduce the separation efficiency and weaken the C2H6-selective adsorption behavior.
  </p>
  <p>
   Moreover, to understand the preferential adsorption sites and the host-guest interactions, the snapshots of each single adsorbed C2H4 and C2H6 molecule in Pore I or Pore II are, respectively, presented in Figure 5. In Pore I (Figure 5a,b), both of the C2H4 and C2H6 possess two weak C-H π (3.251 and 3.383 Å for C2H4, 3.048 and 2.925 Å for C2H6) interactions with two perpendicular pyridine rings. (35) For Pore II (Figure 5c,d), the two gas molecules exhibit even more pronounced differentiation in interaction affinity with the framework. The single C2H4 molecule could only form one weak C-H π (3.757 Å) interaction with the pyridine ring. However, the C2H6 with larger molecule size and polarizability has stronger C-H π (2.721 and 3.542 Å) interactions and one C-H N (3.249 Å) hydrogen bond.
  </p>
  <p>
   Therefore, the microscopic insights of the computational study suggest that Pore II with a more suitable size (or the pore effect) is a key factor for the C2H6-selective adsorption behavior, due to the C2H6 with stronger hydrogen-bonding interactions, especially at low-pressure.
  </p>
  <h2>
   3.5. Adsorption Selectivity of Ni-4PyC for C2H6/C2H4
  </h2>
  <p>
   The IAST adsorption selectivity toward the C2H6/C2H4 (1/15, v/v) mixture was estimated, where the dual site Langmuir-Freundlich (DSLF) model was applied to fit the pure component isotherms of C2H6 and C2H4. Table S4 presents a detailed description and fitting parameters.
  </p>
  <p>
   The IAST-predicted selectivity of Ni-4PyC for the C2H6/C2H4 binary mixture is presented in Figure 6. The IAST calculated selectivity is in the range of 1.7-7.0. In the low-pressure region (0-10 kPa), the selectivity was high up to 7.0. However, the selectivity decreased sharply when the pressure increased to 10 kPa, and it remained approximately unchanged at 1.7 despite a further increase in pressure. As listed in Table S2, the C2H6/C2H4 selectivity on Ni-4PyC was higher than some previously reported C2H6-selective adsorbents.
  </p>
  <h2>
   3.6. C2H6/C2H4 Breakthrough Experiments
  </h2>
  <p>
   The interesting C2H6-selective adsorption behavior of Ni-4PyC encouraged us to further investigate its dynamic C2H4 purification performance under fixed-bed breakthrough experiments. During the breakthrough experiments, the flow rate of the C2H6/C2H4 (1:15, v/v) mixture was 2 mL/min. Figure 7 is the result of breakthrough experiment, two distinct breakthrough curves indicate that C2H4 can be well purified from the simulated cracking gas mixture in the dynamic adsorption process by Ni-4PyC. It can be observed that C2H4 first eluted from the column at 10.6 min, and then after a 2 min-interval, C2H6 eluted out. Compared with C2H4, C2H6 has a longer breakthrough time, which further confirmed that stronger interactions exist between the frameworks of Ni-4PyC with C2H6 molecules. No significant overshoot was observed in the breakthrough curves of C2H4. As for C2H6, the breakthrough curves slowly increased due to the existence of mass transfer resistance and axial dispersion in the adsorption column. (51)
  </p>
  <h2>
   3.7. Breakthrough Cycling Test
  </h2>
  <p>
   The recyclability of Ni-4PyC was confirmed by the breakthrough-cycling test, during which the regeneration of the adsorption column was conducted under 424 K for 60 min with constant helium (He) gas flow (20 mL/min). As shown in Figure 8, almost identical breakthrough curves for C2H6/C2H4 binary mixture were obtained in five cycles of breakthrough experiments, which suggest that the dynamic separation performance of Ni-4PyC was well preserved during several times of regeneration. More importantly, these results showed that this material has excellent durability together with high potential in practical applications.
  </p>
  <h2>
   4. Conclusions
  </h2>
  <p>
   To sum up, we studied the C2H6-selective behavior of Ni-4PyC together with its separation performance toward the binary mixture of C2H6/C2H4. Pure component isotherms on Ni-4PyC showed that the framework had larger C2H6 adsorption capacities at experimental conditions. The breakthrough experiments further confirmed its dynamic separation performance. Moreover, molecular simulation revealed that the C2H6-selective adsorption behavior mainly happened in the larger pore in the low-pressure range, where the pore effect together with stronger hydrogen-bonding interactions between the framework of Ni-4PyC and C2H6 molecules dominates the C2H6-selective behavior. Hence, Ni-4PyC with excellent cycle performance and moderate C2H6 adsorption capacity and selectivity might be a good candidate for further use in real-world applications.
