   Abstract

  <p>
   High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideCost-effective adsorption-based C2H2/C2H4 and C2H2/CO2 gas separations are extremely important in the industry. Herein, a pH-stable three-dimensional (3D) metal-organic framework (MOF), IITKGP-25, possessing exposed functional sites is presented, which facilitates such separations with excellent ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) selectivity (4.61 for C2H2/C2H4 and 3.93 for C2H2/CO2) under ambient conditions (295 K, 100 kPa, 50:50 gas mixtures) and a moderate affinity toward C2H2 (26.6 kJ mol-1). Interestingly, IITKGP-25 can maintain structural integrity in water and in aqueous acidic/alkaline (pH = 2-10) medium because of the higher coordination numbers around the metal center and the hydrophobicity of the ligand. The adsorption capacity for C2H2 remains unchanged for a minimum of up to five consecutive cycles and 15 days of exposure to 97% relative humidity, which are the prerequisites of an adsorbent for practical gas separation application. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the open Cd(II) sites and carboxylate oxygen-coordinated Cd(II) corner of the triangle-shaped one-dimensional (1D) channel are the enthalpically more preferred binding sites for C2H2, which stabilize the adsorbed C2H2 through nonlocal stronger H-bonding and also pπ-dπ and CH-π interactions.

   Introduction
  </h2>
  <p>
   High-purity acetylene (C2H2) and ethylene (C2H4) are widely used chemical raw materials for the industry and for various polymeric products. The market for both C2H2 and C2H4 is rapidly expanding worldwide, for example, C2H2 production will reach >100 million tons at the end of 2024 with a steady annual growth of 3% during this period. (1) C2H4 is produced through steam cracking of hydrocarbons in which a trace amount of C2H2 (about 1%) is inevitably present as an impurity. (2) The presence of C2H2 leads to catalyst deactivation during the C2H4 polymerization reaction and thus can significantly affect the quality of the end product, polyethylene. On the other hand, during the C2H2 production via thermal cracking, CO2 is also produced. (2,3) Nevertheless, to obtain pure-grade C2H2 and polymer-grade C2H4, it is important to separate them from the mixtures (C2H2 from a C2H4-rich mixture and CO2 from C2H2). Currently, the traditional cryogenic distillation technique is used to purify these chemical mixtures, which costs an enormous energy penalty. (4) Developing energy-efficient separation methods of C2H2 and C2H4 from the mixtures (C2H2/C2H4 and C2H2/CO2) is highly important for the production of polymer-grade C2H2 and C2H4 and possesses daunting industrial challenges. (5-8) The demand for energy-intensive methods motivates researchers to seek an alternate energy-efficient method, such as a nonthermal physical adsorbent for the purifications of C2H2 and C2H4 from their mixtures which has high industrial importance and can supersede traditional methods. (5-23) However, due to the close physical properties of C2H2, CO2, and C2H4 (Table S1; boiling point: 189.3 K, C2H2; 194.7 K, CO2; and 169.4 K, C2H4) and subtle difference in molecular size (kinetic diameter: C2H2, 3.3; CO2, 3.3; and C2H4, 4.2 Å), developing a suitable porous adsorbent for selective capture and separation through pressure swing absorption (PSA) is extremely challenging. (5-23) Several porous materials, such as zeolites, porous carbon, etc.. have been investigated for these important separations, which however show poor selectivity. (24,25)
  </p>
  <p>
   In this context, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are the new hotspots as efficient separation materials due to their microporous nature and customizable design property and can easily be synthesized from the available starting materials under hydrothermal and/or room temperature conditions. (5-8,26,27) This mushrooming class of materials has been explored for various applications including gas storage and separation ranging from biogas (CO2/CH4), (27) and flue gas (CO2/N2) (27) to difficult gas mixtures such as olefin/paraffin (5-8) and alkyne/alkene (5-8) separation. (27-37) Generally, the sieving effect and pore functionalization are the two major design approaches used in the field of gas separations. (5-8,26,38-46) However, the sieving effect needs precise control over pore size and shape in MOFs and thus can realize the challenging gas separation. (47) Nevertheless, the precise control of pore size in MOFs not only is difficult to achieve but also can substantially reduce the adsorption capacity in MOFs. (5-8,26,47) On the other hand, very large pores may increase the uptake capacity, however, at the cost of reduced selectivity. For example, Chen et al. investigated the MOF-74 series, in which Fe-MOF-74 showed a very high C2H2 uptake capacity of 6.66 mmol g-1 (at 45 °C), however, with a poor selectivity of only 2.1 (1 bar and 45 °C). (48,49) Therefore, MOFs with matching void spaces along with functional binding sites can balance the trade-off between selectivity and adsorption capacity. (5-8,26,27,47)
  </p>
  <p>
   Other than the gas uptakes and selectivity, structural stability in water/humid environments is another crucial aspect of MOF-based adsorbents for the implementation in industrial-scale gas separations due to the presence of various levels of humidity in the gas mixtures, and it is a tedious task to dry them. (26,27) Especially, moisture or water-containing environments and many other harsh acidic environments are unavoidable in the practical separation process. For example, for a variety of gas separation/purification processes (such as natural gas, flue gas, and biogas) by adsorption-based materials, the stability of such adsorbents at a high level of humidity needs to be taken into account. (26,27) SO2 and/or H2S usually occurs in industrial gas streams; they are considered to be acidic gases; thus, in addition to moisture/water stability, pH stability of the porous adsorbents is again an important prerequisite for such applications. (26,27) Given the presence of acidic impurities in various feed gas mixtures, the development of pH-stable MOFs is of great interest for practical gas separation applications. Although several examples of water/humidity-stable MOFs could be found for the separation of flue gas (CO2/N2; 15:85) (27) and landfill gas mixtures (CO2/CH4; 50:50), (27) less attention has been paid to developing moisture/water-stable frameworks for industrially important C2H2 and C2H4 separation from the mixtures. (5-8,26,50) Therefore, there is a significant need to develop porous MOF-based adsorbents with functionalized interior surfaces exhibiting excellent adsorption capacity with high selectivity and preferably stable over a wide pH range for practical applications.
  </p>
  <p>
   The suitable pore size with exposed functionality may balance the trade-off between the amount adsorbed and the selectivity; with this in mind, here, we have presented the design and synthesis of a rarely explored tetracarboxylate ligand, 5-(4,5-bis(4-carboxyphenyl)-1H-imidazol-2-yl)isophthalic acid (H4IIPA), for the construction of a MOF (Scheme S1). The reaction of H4IIPA with Cd(NO3)2 4H2O under hydrothermal conditions yields a robust three-dimensional (3D) microporous MOF, [{Cd1.5(HIIPA)(H2O)2} xG]n, (G represents the disordered solvents in pores; termed as IITKGP-25) with a suitable pore size (5 × 6 Å2) decorated with exposed carboxylate oxygen atoms and framed with plenty of phenyl rings for plausible interactions with C2H2 through H-bonding and C-H π interactions. It is to be noted that this functional ligand is rarely explored for MOF construction, and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on gas adsorption and separation on MOFs constructed with this ligand. (51)IITKGP-25 exhibits excellent stability in water and in acidic/alkaline medium (pH 2-10). The single-component gas adsorption indicated that IITKGP-25a (activated framework) preferentially takes up C2H2 over C2H4 and CO2 with the ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) selectivity of the C2H2/C2H4 (50:50) mixture being 4.6 and the C2H2/CO2 (50:50) mixture selectivity of 3.9 (at 295 K under 1 bar). Furthermore, computational investigation reveals a greater binding affinity of IITKGP-25a for C2H2 compared to CO2 and C2H4 due to the long-range stronger H-bonding and also relatively modest pπ-dπ and CH-π interactions.

   Results and Discussion
  </h2>
  <p>
   X-ray single-crystal analysis revealed that IITKGP-25 crystallizes in a monoclinic crystal system under the C2/c space group (Table S2) having a 3D porous structure with a high density of coordinated water and carboxylate oxygen atoms decorating the one-dimensional (1D) pore surface (Figure 1). As depicted in Figure S3, two crystallographically independent Cd(II) ions and one deprotonated IIPA4- (with a protonated imidazole core) are present in the asymmetric unit of IITKGP-25, where Cd1 and Cd2 are octa- and hexa-coordinated respectively. The trinuclear Cd(II) secondary building unit (Figures 1a and S4), Cd3(μ-O2CR)4, can be generated through the symmetry operation of Cd2#1-Cd1-Cd2#2 (#1: -x, 1 - y, 1 - z; #2: x, 1 - y, -0.5 + z) and the deprotonated IIPA4- ligand. In the trinuclear secondary building unit, the central Cd1 ion is surrounded by eight oxygen atoms, Cd-O = 2.387-2.475 (Table S3), coming from the four carboxylate groups of the deprotonated IIPA4- ligand in the μ2-η1, η1 mode. On the other hand, the terminal Cd2 ion is surrounded by six oxygen atoms; among them, four come from the different deprotonated IIPA4- ligands (O1, O4, μ2-η1,η1 Cd-O = 2.322-2.456 Å; O6, O8, η1, Cd-O = 2.133-2.233 Å) and the other two are from coordinated water molecules (OW1, OW2; Cd-O = 2.242-2.414 Å) (Figure S4 and Table S3). One IIPA4- connects four trinuclear Cd(II) secondary building units, and each Cd(II) secondary building unit further connects six IIPA4- ligands, resulting in a three-dimensional framework stabilized by several nonbonding interactions (Table S4) such as N-H O (carboxylate and water) and C-H O (carboxylate and water) interactions as depicted in Figure S5. IITKGP-25 contains a one-dimensional triangular channel with a cross-section of 5 × 6 Å2 (measured by fitting dummy spheres in Diamond 3.0 software) considering van der Waals radii along the [110] direction (Figure 1b,c). The framework also contains a comparatively smaller 1D channel across the crystallographic "c" axis (Figures S6-S9). It is worth noting that these 1D channels are decorated with coordinated water molecules projected toward the channels along with carboxylate oxygen atoms (Figures S6-S9) framed with phenyl moieties, which thus may interact with acetylene to influence the gas separation performance in its guest-free framework of IITKGP-25a through multiple host-guest interactions. The pore void calculation from PLATON shows that IITKGP-25 has a potential solvent-accessible volume of 2582.0 Å3 (38.34%) per unit cell volume of 6733.4 Å3 of the total framework.

   To check the bulk-phase purity of IITKGP-25, the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern of the as-synthesized IITKGP-25 was investigated. The experimental PXRD pattern completely coincided with the calculated pattern obtained from the single-crystal X-ray data (Figure 2a). For the water stability test, the as-synthesized IITKGP-25 was immersed in liquid water for 24 h. Furthermore, it was immersed in aqueous HCl (pH = 2) and aqueous NaOH (pH = 10) solutions for 24 h to check the stabilities under acidic/alkaline environments. In all the cases (Figure 2b), the framework maintained structural integrity and the corresponding PXRD pattern matched well with the as-synthesized samples, suggesting the robustness of the framework. In addition to PXRD, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is a supplementary technique to analyze the stability against water. Thus, SEM images of the as-synthesized IITKGP-25 and after exposure to water were collected (Figure S10), showing no changes in morphology and that no cracks appeared on the surface. The results thus supported the robust nature of the framework in the presence of water and in acidic/alkaline medium. The chemical stabilities of IITKGP-25 in normal laboratory solvents (dimethylformamide (DMF), N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA), MeOH, EtOH, CHCl3, and CH3CN) were also checked by immersing in the respective solvents for 24 h and after exposing the as-synthesized IITKGP-25 in the laboratory open air for 15 days (Figure S11). In all these cases, identical PXRD patterns to those of the as-synthesized material are obtained, suggesting the framework's robustness. Such superior robustness could be ascribed to the high amount of rare octa-coordination by four carboxylates in a chelating fashion to the Cd1 center where both the higher coordination and entropy-driven chelation contribute to the stability and thus the robustness of the framework. On the other hand, three hydrophobic phenyl rings around the core imidazole moiety further prevent the water molecules from attacking the metal nodes. Thus, the combined effects of these two possibly make the overall framework pH-stable. Furthermore, to determine the thermal stability, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed under a N2 atmosphere (Figure S12). The TGA graph showed 10% weight loss up to 120 °C, which was attributed to the loss of coordinated and guest solvent molecules. Notably, the framework can maintain high thermal stability up to 380 °C before being degraded.
  </p>
  <p>
   To evaluate the permanent porosity of IITKGP-25, 50 mg of the as-synthesized sample of IITKGP-25 was exchanged with dry methanol for 48 h followed by heating under a vacuum at 80 °C for 10 h to remove the lattice and coordinated water molecules. The PXRD pattern and IR data indicated the framework stability after the removal of the guests and coordinated solvents from the channels (Figures 2a and S13). The N2 sorption isotherm at 77K for IITKGP-25a showed a very low uptake of N2 as observed for many microporous MOFs due to the very slow diffusion of N2 through the micropores. (52) Thus, a 195 K CO2 sorption measurement was performed; IITKGP-25a showed a uptake of 109 cm3 g-1 at P/Po = 1, giving a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of 262 m2 g-1 (Langmuir surface area of 425 m2 g-1) and a total pore volume of 0.098 cm3 g-1 (Figures 3a and S14). This surface area was comparable to that of the reported Cd-based MOFs for gas sorption and separation applications. (46)

   The ultrahigh stability, porous nature, and presence of functionalized micropore channels (open metal sites and carboxylate O-lined pore channels) prompted us to explore the gas adsorption performance of IITKGP-25a at 273 and 295 K under 1 bar pressure. Therefore, low-pressure gas adsorption data were collected for C2H2, C2H4, and CO2 at both temperatures. As depicted in Figure 3b, at 273 K under 1 bar pressure, the uptake values are 63 (2.81 mmol g-1), 56 (2.5 mmol g-1), and 42.1 (1.87 mmol g-1) cm3 g-1 for C2H2, CO2, and C2H4, respectively, (corresponding to 1.88, 1.67, and 1.25 molecules per asymmetric unit), while these values are 58.1 (2.60 mmol g-1), 42.8 (1.91 mmol g-1), and 31(1.38 mmol g-1) cm3 g-1 (corresponding to 1.73, 1.27, and 0.92 molecules per formula unit) at 295 K under 1 bar pressure (Figure 3c). The results indicate that IITKGP-25a is more selective toward C2H2 than similar size CO2 and C2H4 at both temperatures. The high C2H2 uptake is attributed to the suitable aperture size of 5 × 6 Å2 enriched with carboxylate O and open Cd(II) sites. Although the aperture size is suitable for all the guest molecules, the higher acidity of C2H2 compared to that of the other guests leads to higher Coulomb interactions between the C2H2 molecules and the open Cd(II) charge density. In addition, the higher polarizability and larger quadruple moment of C2H2 than those of CO2 support the high uptake of C2H2 having a similar kinetic diameter. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed to identify the role of open Cd(II) sites and the carboxylate O atoms, suggesting the facile interaction with the guest C2H2 molecules as discussed in the subsequent section. The modest C2H2 uptake values at 295 K of IITKGP-25a are similar to some of the literature reports such as UTSA-68 (53) (70.1 cm3 g-1); ZJU-30 (54) (51.8 cm3 g-1); MIL-53 (55) (72 cm3 g-1); MAF-2 (56) (70 cm3 g-1); UTSA-35 (57) (65 cm3 g-1); UTSA-300a (45) (68.9 cm3 g-1), and NKMOF-1-Ni (58) (61 cm3 g-1), however, higher than that of Ni3(pzdc)2(7 Hade)2, (40) indicating its C2H2 separation potential from CO2 and C2H4 gas mixtures (Table S6). Interestingly, C2H2 shows a sharp uptake at low pressure, and the corresponding uptake value under 0.1 bar is 27.5 cm3 g-1 at 295 K (Figure 3c). On the contrary, the uptake values for C2H4 and CO2 under such conditions are 15 and 9 cm3 g-1, respectively, at 295 K (Figure 3c). The steep uptake of C2H2 at low pressure at both temperatures indicates the potential ability of IITKGP-25a toward the challenging C2H2/C2H4 and C2H2/CO2 separations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Isosteric adsorption enthalpies (Qst) were calculated for the individual gases from the single-component gas adsorption data using the virial equations to access the affinity of the gases toward IITKGP-25a (Figures S15-S17). At zero loading, the Qst values for C2H2, C2H4, and CO2 are found to be 26.6, 19.7, and 17.7 kJ mol-1, respectively (Figure 3d). However, the Qst value increases with C2H4 loading, which might be due to the increased adsorbate-adsorbate interactions at higher loading. These values are in sequence with the gas uptake amounts at lower pressure. The highest Qst value for C2H2 among the three indicates a stronger affinity of IITKGP-25a toward C2H2. Although the Qst value for C2H2 is higher than MOF-OH/NH2 which has the lowest Qst value reported thus far, (59) this value is lower than that of some well-known C2H2 selective MOFs and other porous adsorbents such as SIFSIX-2-Cu-i (42) (41.9 kJ mol-1); HOF-1a (60) (58.1 kJ mol-1); NKMOF-1-Ni (58) (60.3 kJ mol-1); and PAF-110 (61) (38.4 kJ mol-1); and UTSA-60a (62) (36 kJ mol-1) (Figure 3e). It is to be noted that the higher Qst value indicates stronger interactions between the gas molecules and the guest-free framework, hindering the facile regeneration of the framework for the recycling operation, and thus, an optimum value is sought for potential gas separation applications.
  </p>
  <p>
   Motivated by the preferential C2H2 uptake capacity of IITKGP-25a, its C2H2 separation ability from C2H2/C2H4- and C2H2/CO2-containing mixtures is explored. The ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) is employed to determine the C2H2/C2H4 (1:99 and 50:50) selectivity, from a binary gas mixture below 100 kPa. (63) The dual-site Langmuir-Freundlich (DSLF) equation was employed to fit the single-component gas sorption data (Figures S18-S20), and the corresponding fitting parameters (Table S5) were used to calculate the binary gas sorption isotherms and selectivity through the IAST method. As depicted in Figure 4a,c, at 273 K under 100 kPa for 1:99 and 50:50 C2H2/C2H4 mixtures, the selectivity was 3.41 and 3.94, respectively. On the other hand, at 295 K, for C2H2/C2H4, the selectivity value was 3.39 (1:99) and 4.61 (50:50) (Figure 4b,d). These C2H2/C2H4 selectivity values at 295 K were higher and/or comparable to those of PAF-110 (61) (3.9-8.0; 50:50); NUM-11 (64) (3.0, 50:50); CTF-PO71 (65) (2.8; 50:50); Fe-MOF-74 (48,49) (1.87; 50:50); M′MOF-2a (66) (1.93; 50:50); NOTT-300 (67) (2.3; 50:50); and ZJNU-14 (1.59; 1:99 at 298 K) (68) but lower than those of SIFSIX-2-Cu-I (42) (41.01; 50:50) and UTSA-300a (45) ( > 104; 50:50) as depicted in Figure 3f.
  </p>
  <p>
   Furthermore, we have calculated the separation performance with a 50:50 C2H2/CO2 mixture (Figure 4e,f). The corresponding IAST selectivity values are 5.23 at 273 K and 3.93 at 295 K. The equimolar C2H2/CO2 separation selectivity value at 295K is also comparable to those of some of the benchmark materials, such as ZrT-1-tetrazol (1) (2.83); M'MOF-2a (66) (1.89); FJU-6-TATB (69) (5.3-3.1); NUM-15a (2.8); (70) and ZJNU-14 (3.42; at 298 K) (68) but significantly higher than those of many reported MOFs, such as FJU-36 (71) (2.8); UTSA-222 (72) (4.0); and ZJNU-100 (73) (3.8) (Table S6).
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to the gas separation selectivity, the uptake capacity of C2H2 in the mixed gas phase (C2H2/C2H4: 50/50; and C2H2/CO2: 50/50) at equilibrium was further determined through the IAST methods to access the actual performance of IITKGP-25a. As shown in Figure 3c-f, C2H2 loadings for the binary gas mixtures (C2H2/C2H4, and C2H2/CO2) at 273 and 295 K under 100 kPa were considerably higher compared to those of CO2 and C2H4. The corresponding uptake values of C2H2 from the binary C2H2/C2H4 (50/50) were 1.95 and 1.73 mmol, whereas for the C2H2/CO2 (50/50) mixture, they were 2.17 and 1.84 mmol at 273 and 295 K, respectively. Such high loadings of C2H2 in the mixed gas phases indicated the potential of the IITKGP-25a for the purification of C2H2 and C2H4.

   From a practical point of view, the structural stability of MOFs after exposure to humidity/water is highly desirable. In general, classical MOFs are unstable under moisture/water, thus limiting their potential as adsorbent materials for real gas separation applications because most of the feed gas mixtures do contain a wide range of moisture. (27) Thus, MOF materials must be stable in a humid environment and should have the ability to take up the target gas in a similar quantity to that of the unexposed material. As discussed before, this MOF shows a high degree of structural stability over a broad range of pH (2-10) and does exhibit selective C2H2 sorption from C2H4 and CO2. The C2H2 sorption performance is thus investigated after moisture treatment of this MOF IITKGP-25. For this, the as-synthesized sample of IITKGP-25 is exposed to 97% relative humidity for 7 and 14 days (see the Supporting Information) under a closed environment. As expected, the framework remains unaffected after exposure to the humidity (Figure S11). The C2H2 adsorption at 273 K on this moisture-exposed sample (solvent exchanged followed by activation) shows a similar amount of C2H2 uptake to that of the pristine sample (Figure 5a). However, to check the real gas separation performance of an adsorbent, breakthrough separation under moist conditions needs to be evaluated. Moreover, the C2H2 data of multiple cycles at 273 K are collected to check the cyclic stability of the IITKGP-25a. After each adsorption/desorption cycle, IITKGP-25a is regenerated only by applying in situ vacuum for one hour and proceeded to the subsequent cycles. The cyclic performance could be maintained for a minimum of five cycles without a negligible loss in C2H2 uptake capacity (Figure 5b), thus suggesting its high structural stability over cyclic adsorption/desorption (Figure S21). Considering the pH and water stability, the results presented herein show the great promise of this MOF material toward C2H2/C2H4 and C2H2/CO2 gas separations under ambient conditions.

   To better understand the possible binding sites, relative energetics, and selectivity of IITKGP-25 for C2H2, C2H4, and CO2, dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT-D) calculations are carried out considering a single-gas molecule adsorption to the MOF, which reasonably well mimics the low-loading density. The gas adsorption strength as quantified by the binding energy (Eb) is calculated with the following formulaEb = EMOF+Gas-EMOF-EGas(1)
  </p>
  <p>
   In eq 1, EMOF+Gas, EMOF, and EGas represent the total energy of the optimized IITKGP-25 loaded with an adsorbed gas molecule, the isolated IITKGP-25, and the gas molecule, respectively. A negative Eb is indicative of enthalpically favored adsorption of the gas molecule to IITKGP-25. Simulation details are provided in the Supporting Information (SI). Two lowest-energy binding configurations are identified for the C2H2 in IITKGP-25a (see Config-a and Config-b in Figure 6). The C═C bond π-electron cloud in C2H2 forms a η2 coordination with an open Cd(II) metal center via pπ-dπ, which together with a stronger H-bonding interaction of acidic H of C2H2 with the neighboring carboxylate oxygen of the MOF led to much stronger binding as is also quantified by the calculated Eb of ~-83.5 kJ mol-1. Notably, the H-bond distance of ca. ~1.92 Å falls within the regime of strong H-bonding interaction (see Config-a from Figure 6). Additionally, an alternate binding site characterized by the noncovalent CH-π-type interaction between the MOF phenyl ring and H of C2H2 exhibits a much smaller Eb of ~-21.2 kJ mol-1 (see Config-b from Figure 6). These enthalpically favored binding sites support the high uptake of IITKGP-25a for C2H2, whereas C2H4 forms a π-π stacked configuration with the ligand phenyl ring of the MOF with a stacking distance of ~3.5 Å, yielding a moderate Eb of ~-25.4 kJ mol-1 (see Figure S22). In contrast, a relatively much smaller Eb of ~-19.2 kJ mol-1 is found for the CO2, which mainly results from the slipped π-π stacking interaction with the ligand phenyl ring with a stacking distance of ~3.4 Å (see the CO2 binding configuration in Figure S22). The calculated Eb follows the order C2H2≫ C2H4 > CO2, which qualitatively explains the selectivity of IITKGP-25a for the C2H2 and also its estimated high uptake in a mixture with the other two gases explored. Importantly, we note that while nonlocal van der Waals interaction of ca. -17.2 to -26.4 kJ mol-1 stabilizes the adsorbed gas molecule within the MOF pocket, a significant contribution from the H-bonding interaction combined with an enthalpically favored pπ-dπ interaction due to the η2 coordination is found to be responsible for the selective and high uptake of C2H2.

   Conclusions

  <p>
   In summary, we have developed a 3D microporous pH-stable MOF, IITKGP-25, with the rarely explored H4IIPA ligand, featuring 1D functional channels for selective C2H2 binding into its pore over CO2 and C2H4 gases. The uptake capacity remains the same after being exposed to 97% RH for a minimum of 14 days and also after a minimum of five adsorption/desorption cycles. The moderately high C2H2 uptake and separation selectivity with lower Qst and thus its facile regeneration properties and excellent chemical (water and pH) and recycling stability make IITKGP-25 a promising candidate for potential gas separation application. The computational study reveals that the adsorption selectivity for C2H2/C2H4 and C2H2/CO2 is mainly attributed to the strong interaction between the C2H2 and the activated framework of IITKGP-25a, through an open Cd(II) metal center via pπ-dπ, H-bonding, and CH π interactions. Given that the poor stability of classic porous MOFs in humid/water environments is of serious concern, this work is expected to contribute to the development of pH-stable MOFs for their various applications in water/moisture-containing media including their potential in gas separations.
