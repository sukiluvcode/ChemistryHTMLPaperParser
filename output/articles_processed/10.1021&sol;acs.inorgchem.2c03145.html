   Introduction
  </h2>
  <p>
   Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), consisting of various inorganic metal clusters and organic ligands, (1) have been developed rapidly in recent two decades due to their high porosity, (2) facile tunability, (3) and extensive application range. (4) Among those applications, gas storage and separation are more promising for industrial applications. (1a,5) Very recently, much work has been focused on providing more recognition sites and narrowing pore size to enhance the gas storage and separation performance, including ligand shortening, (6) functional group insertion, (3a) ligand geometry changes, (7) and coordination site variation. (3b) The tuning of MOFs is mainly based on reticular chemistry, i.e.. finely tailoring the organic part of MOFs based on the same inorganic nodes. Works focusing on tuning the inorganic nodes are rare.
  </p>
  <p>
   In most cases, open metal sites (OMS) and hydroxide on inorganic nodes were more powerful than polar organic functional groups, which could be found in theoretical calculations as well as the experimental phenomenon. (8) Thus, contracting the pore size to be close to the kinetic diameters of the targeted gas and implanting OMS or/and hydroxide groups appears to be an effective way to enhance the gas selectivity. However, the molecules in such channels have to break through many apertures, leading to less energy efficiency. (9)
  </p>
  <p>
   In our recent work, we focused on the implantation of gas recognition pockets/gas trapping in relatively large channels of MOFs for boosting the gas selectivity and transferring efficiency. (10) This thought is in line with the dynamic orthogonal array MOF. (9b) Until now, few common approaches for making MOFs with recognition pockets or gas trapping have been reported. As our continued work to make such type of MOF, 12-connected RE-fcu-MOF (RE, rare earth) was selected for further tuning. (11) In this type of MOF, only one type of narrow triangular window (Figure 1g) could access the inner pore system, (12) similar to those of the tandem array cages as depicted in Scheme 1.
  </p>
  <p>
   Fortunately, this type of MOF could be synthesized stepwise and provide RE metal centers for effective low CO2 concentration capture. (11,12) In the literature, we reported that a lower symmetry ligand would induce a symmetrical matching cluster to boost the thermal stability of the MOF (13) and increasing the steric hindrance could help control the inorganic cluster. (14) The utilization of low symmetry ligands to assemble MOFs with high performance was also reported. (15) These results inspired us to design a Z-type ligand 1,5-naphthalenedicarboxylate (1,5-H2NDC) based on 1,4-H2NDC (Scheme 2) with the aim to lower the symmetry and increase the steric hindrance simultaneously. We expected that 1,5-H2NDC could induce or make a hexanuclear yttrium cluster with a defect to partly break the aforementioned contracted triangular channel, thus enabling the resulting MOF to own a polar flow channel with originally existing powerful CO2 recognition sites.

   Structural Description
  </h2>
  <p>
   As expected, the reaction between Y(NO3)2 6H2O and 1,5-H2NDC together with nitric acid results in a 10-connected hexanuclear cluster in NTUniv-57 {Y6(OH)8(1,5-NDC)5 4DMF 2H2O}. Single X-ray analysis shows that the space group is P21/n, and there are two kinds of Y3+ ions. Two Y3+ ions at the top and bottom of the octahedron are surrounded by four μ3-OH groups and four oxygen atoms from carboxylate groups from four independent 1,5-NDC2- ligands. The ninth coordination site was occupied by dimethylformamide (DMF). Interestingly, the other four Y3+ ions at the middle of the octahedron were also surrounded by four μ3-OH groups, but three oxygen atoms from three 1,5-NDC2- ligands. The eighth site was coordinated by water or DMF, giving the resulting cluster [Y6(μ3-OH)8(1,5-NDC)5] a 10-connected node (Figure 1d). So far, as we know, other reported hexanuclear RE clusters are generally 8-, 9-, and 12-connected nodes. (11,16) Those 10-connected nodes are further connected by the ligands to form the final three-dimensional (3-D) structure with a narrow channel of ca. 6 Å × 8 Å, around which there are abundant pocket cages consisting of three ligands and two hydroxide groups (Figure 1i).
  </p>
  <p>
   From the perspective of reducing symmetry, (1) the space group was changed from the highly symmetrical Fm3m (RE-MOFs) to P21/n and (2) the RE node was also changed to adapt to the lower symmetrical 1,5-NDC2- ligand. Due to the absence of the two 1,5-NDC2- ligands of the RE node, the narrow triangular window that commonly exists in RE-MOFs was removed; thus, a relatively large channel was formed in NTUniv-57. Due to the Z-type ligands, the size of the formed channel was only 8 Å, while the corresponding size in the original RE-MOF was 16 Å (Figure 1g). In NTUniv-57, two metal sites merged with two μ3-OH forming four united polar recognition sites (Figure 1f), which were densely inset in the relatively large polar channel (Figure 1h). The OMS density was calculated to be 3.13 mmol g-1 based on the crystal data. The metal site on the 12-connected RE node was isolated in two kinds of cages (Figure 1c).

  <h2>
   Gas Adsorptions and Separations
  </h2>
  <p>
   A weight loss of ~15.9 wt % for NTUniv-57 in the range of 25-200 °C could be seen from the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) data, in which NTUniv-57 begins to collapse near 230 °C, ensuring it could be activated by frequently used heating and pumping (Figure S3). The purity of NTUniv-57 produced in large amounts could be verified by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) (Figure S1). NTUniv-57 also shows high chemical stability, and the framework could retain its structure in H2O for 1 month and in aqueous solutions with a pH of 4-10 (Figure S2). The obtained sample of NTUniv-57 was placed in acetone for 3 days for the replacement of the water and DMF molecules in the pore and then degassed at 110 °C under high vacuum (molecular turbo pump) for 12 h to afford the activated material.
  </p>
  <p>
   The CO2 adsorption isotherm at 195 K showed a type-I isotherm, indicating the retention of microporosity after the activation process (Figure 2a), while no N2 adsorption could be found under 77 K. DFT theory of the CO2 isotherm data exhibits a narrow distribution of micropores around 6 and 8 Å (Figure 2b), which were consistent with the data measured from the single-crystal X-ray structure. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Langmuir surface areas for NTUniv-57 based on the CO2 isotherm were calculated to be 224 and 259 m2 g-1, respectively.
  </p>
  <p>
   The high water stability and narrow channel with densely decorated open metal sites of NTUniv-57 inspired us to investigate its CO2 selective uptake capacity. Moderate CO2 uptake values of 31 and 19.5 cm3 g-1 can be observed under 1 bar at 273 and 296 K, respectively. In contrast to CO2 adsorption, only limited amounts of CH4 (5.8 and 2.03 cm3 g-1 at 273 and 296 K, respectively, under 1 bar) and N2 (1.66 and 0.58 cm3 g-1 at 273 and 296 K, respectively, under 1 bar) can be adsorbed in NTUniv-57 (Figure 2d). The Qst of CO2 and CH4 were calculated to be 36.9 and 17.6 kJ mol-1, respectively. This phenomenon indicates that NTUniv-57 may be a potential material for CO2 capture and purification of methane. Based on IAST theory, the separation ratios of CO2/N2 (0.1/0.90) and CO2/CH4 (0.95/0.05) at 296 K are 322 and 108, respectively (Figure 2f), while the data of RE-MOF based on 1,4-H2NDC under the same conditions were 82 and 16, (12) respectively. This comparison indicated that after tuning the ligand slightly, the CO2 selective adsorption performance of the final MOF was obviously boosted. The values of NTUniv-57 were higher than those of Ln-MOFs (17) and those of MOFs with OMS and basic functionalities (ZJNU-154 (18) and NJU-Bai14 (19)) under the same conditions but obviously lower than those of the famous MOFs. (20)
  </p>
  <p>
   As shown in Figure 2c, the C2H2, C2H4, and C2H6 uptake amounts of NTUniv-57 are 35, 25, and 23 cm3 g-1, respectively, at 273 K under 1 bar, while at 296 K, the values are decreased to 19, 15, and 13 cm3 g-1, respectively. As shown in Figure 2e, the Qst for C2H2, C2H4, and C2H6 are 45.4, 41.5, and 30.6 kJ mol-1, respectively. From the above adsorption isotherms, NTUniv-57 shows larger adsorptive quantities and stronger interactions of C2Hn than that of CH4. At 298 K and 1 bar, the molar ratios of the C2H2/CH4, C2H4/CH4, and C2H6/CH4 uptake capacities are about 9.35, 7.4, and 6.4, respectively, indicating that it can be used for natural gas purification applications. The IAST method was used to predict the adsorption selectivity. As shown in Figure 2g, with the pressure increasing, the C2H2/CH4 and C2H4/CH4 adsorption selectivities first drop and then increase, while those of C2H6/CH4 exhibit a monotonic upward trend. When the temperature is lowered, the adsorption selectivities increase, though the C2H6/CH4 selectivity at 296 K is slightly higher than that at 273 K at low pressure. Specifically, the C2H2/CH4, C2H4/CH4, and C2H6/CH4 adsorption selectivities at 296 K and 1 bar are 137, 37, and 34, respectively. Those values are significantly higher than those of most MOFs reported for C2/C1 separation, such as UTSA-33 (18, 12, and 16), (21) UTSA-34 (23, 17, and 16), (22) UTSA-35 (20, 10, and 14), (23) SBMOF-2 (18, 16, and 26), (24) FJI-C1 (9.7, 6.6, and 9), (25) ZJNU-15 (38, 17, and 23), (18) ZJNU-63 (13.1, 7, and 10.6), (17b) MFM-202 (9.0, 7.3, and 10.2), (26) and LaBTB (N/A, 12, and 22). (27)
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, IAST calculations were also performed to predict the adsorption selectivity of C2H2/C2H4. As shown in Figure 2h, the C2H2/C2H4 adsorption selectivities decrease with increasing pressures, which are insensitive to temperature. At a pressure of 1 bar, the adsorption selectivity is 13.0 at 296 K and 11.9 at 273 K for a 1:99 C2H2/C2H4 mixture. The values surpass those of some recognized MOFs such as Dy-MOF (1.1), (28) ZJNU-14 (1.59), (29) FeMOF-74 (2.08), (30) Cu(TIA) (2.09), (31) NOTT-300 (2.17), (32) dia-[Sc(Hpzc)(pzc)] (3.1), (33) ZJNU-119 (3.5), (34) and NUC-19 (4.0). (35) When the molar ratio of C2H2 varies from 0.01 to 0.99, the C2H2/C2H4 selectivity values fall in the range of 13-1.1 at 298 K and 1 bar. For comparison, the selectivity of C2H2/C2H4 for RE-MOF was also retested; the adsorption selectivity was calculated to be 8.4 at 296 K and 1 bar.

  <h2>
   Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) Simulation
  </h2>
  <p>
   To understand the obviously enhanced gas selectivities of NTUniv-57, the CO2, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, and CH4 adsorption sites were modeled by GCMC simulations. For CO2, the primary adsorption site (Figure 3a) was found at the embedded CO2 pockets, which consists of a -OH group and three ligands. Simulations revealed that the distance between the H atom of the -OH group and the oxygen atom of the CO2 is only 2.07 Å, which is smaller than the sum of the van der Waals radii of the H and O atoms (2.6 Å), indicating that a corresponding stronger O H-O hydrogen bond exists. With more CO2 loading, the CO2 molecules are mainly bonded to the second site, the lone metal site, which was also verified using RE-MOFs. Interestingly, until the CO2 pockets were saturated, there was nearly no CO2 that could be found in the polar large channel. From these simulations, there are more binding sites compared with RE-MOFs; this may be the main reason for the boosted CO2/N2 selectivity.
  </p>
  <p>
   For C2H2 and C2H4, the main adsorption sites were found also at the gas pockets. Two CH π interactions could be observed between C2H2 and the benzene ring with a CH π distance of ~2.36 Å (Figure 3b). Four CH π interactions could be observed between C2H4 and the benzene ring with a CH π distance of 2.63-3.39 Å (Figure 3c). Surprisingly, the main adsorption sites of C2H6 were in the large channel, near the four united polar recognition sites; the main adsorption site of CH4 was similar to that of C2H6 (Figure 3d). Calculations show that there are only H-bonds between the channel and CH4. This may be the reason for the obvious reduction of CH4 uptake when the temperature increased to 296 K. Another reason is that the polar channel provides an unfavorable environment for CH4. (3b,36)

   Conclusions
  </h2>
  <p>
   In summary, the first example of a 10-connected hexanuclear yttrium-based MOF NTUniv-57 was reported, which owns a polar flow channel with embedded gas recognition pockets. It showed enhanced CO2/N2, CO2/CH4, and C2H2/C2H4 adsorption selectivities compared with the original RE-fcu-MOF. Interestingly, this work may provide some evidence for the guess or debate of whether the ligand would induce a symmetrical matching cluster during the formation process of MOFs. More importantly, we provide an example of enlarging the channels of MOFs that can also boost gas selectivity.
