   High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideHighly selective separation and purification of acetylene (C2H2) from ethylene (C2H4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) are daunting challenges in light of their similar molecule sizes and physical properties. Herein, we report a two-dimensional (2D) stable metal-organic framework (MOF), NUM-11 ([Cu(Hmpba)2] 1.5DMF) (H2mpba = 4-(3,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)benzoic acid), with sql topology, stacked together through π-π interactions for efficient separation of C2H2 from C2H4 and CO2. The 2D-MOF material offers high hydrolytic stability and good purification capacity; especially, it could survive in water for 7 months, even longer. This stable MOF selectively captures C2H2 from mixtures containing C2H4 and CO2, as determined by adsorption isotherms. The ideal adsorbed solution theory selectivity calculations and transient breakthrough experiments were performed to verify the separation capacity. The low isosteric heat of NUM-11a (desolvated NUM-11) (18.24 kJ mol-1 for C2H2) validates the feasibility of adsorbent regeneration with low energy footprint consumption. Furthermore, Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations confirmed that the pore surface of the NUM-11 framework enabled preferential binding of C2H2 over C2H4 and CO2 via multiple C-H O, C-H π, and C-H C interactions. This work provides some insights to prepare stable MOF materials toward the purification of C2H2, and the water-stable structure, low isosteric heat, and good cycling stability of NUM-11 make it very promising for practical industrial application.

   Introduction
  </h2>
  <p>
   Acetylene (C2H2) and ethylene (C2H4) are the main petrochemicals considered as basic building blocks in the petrochemical industry. C2H4 is widely used to manufacture kinds of chemicals, such as polyethylene and vinyl chloride. (1) C2H2, as the simplest alkyne, is extensively used as fuel in cutting/welding and is one of the important chemical raw materials for production of numerous synthetic chemicals such as acrylic acid and vinyl chloride. (2) In the petrochemical industry, C2H4 is primarily produced via steam cracking of hydrocarbons, which inevitably coexists with a trace amount of C2H2. The existence of C2H2 would poison the catalysts during ethylene polymerization. (3) Meanwhile, C2H2 is mainly produced by partial combustion of natural gas and/or the cracking of hydrocarbons, which are inevitably mixed with a small amount of C2H4 and carbon dioxide (CO2). (4) Thus, the selective separation of C2H2 from CO2 or C2H4 is the key to obtaining high-quality C2H2 and preparing polymer-grade C2H4. However, in light of analogous molecular structures, such as unsaturated carbon-oxide and carbon-carbon bonds, and their similar physical properties including their kinetic diameter (C2H2: 3.3 Å, CO2: 3.3 Å, C2H4: 4.2 Å), molecular sizes (C2H2: 3.32 × 3.34 × 5.70 Å3, CO2: 3.18 × 3.33 × 5.36 Å3, C2H4: 3.28 × 4.18 × 4.84 Å3), and boiling points (C2H2: 189.3 K, CO2: 194.7 K, C2H4: 169.4 K) (Scheme 1), (5,6) the separation of C2H2 from C2H2/C2H4 and C2H2/CO2 mixtures is still a significant and intricate industrial separation process. (7-9) Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop effective methods to purify C2H2 to achieve the application requirements. Currently, the purification of C2H2 mainly depends on organic solvent extraction or cryogenic distillation, which is environmentally unfriendly, consumes enormous energy, and is accompanied by potential safety hazards. (10) Compared with previous prevailing technologies, nonheat-driven processes such as an adsorptive separation method based on a physical adsorption mechanism could provide an alternative that has a lower energy consumption and is environmentally friendly. (11-14)
  </p>
  <p>
   The adsorptive separation method using selective porous solid materials in light of a physical adsorption mechanism is an effective alternative strategy to energy-intensive cryogenic distillations for greener and efficient separation of C2H2 from C2H2-containing mixtures. The capability for adsorption and separation is mainly influenced by the characteristics of adsorbents, and advances in the science of solid porous materials have promoted the production of kinds of adsorbents with adjustable pore sizes and modifiable function surfaces. Under this background, the development of C2H2-selective multifunctional adsorbents is desperately desired to achieve the goal of related gas separation applications. Some porous solid adsorbents have been used for the C2H2/CO2 or C2H2/C2H4 separation, such as zeolites (Ni@FAU) (15) and hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) (HOF-3, PFC-2). (16,17) Great progress has been made in the application of separation of C2H2/C2H4 (3,18-22) and C2H2/CO2 (4,23,24) mixtures by a series of framework-type porous solid adsorbents, especially the emerging metal-organic frameworks. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), or porous coordination polymers (PCPs), are porous crystalline solid materials composed by metal or metal clusters as inorganic nodes and organic ligands as linkers. (25,26) MOF adsorbents show excellent prospects for adsorption and separation because the host-guest interactions could be adjusted by fine-tuning of the pore environment based on the modular nature of reticulated chemistry, and the host-guest interactions play an important role in adsorptive separation processes. In addition, in the industrial implementation, the stable MOF adsorbents are highly desired, and the stability of MOF adsorbents could be influenced by many factors, including the applied environment, organic ligands, metal ions, coordination geometry, hydrophobicity of the framework, etc. Generally, the relatively unstable coordination bonds are considered to be a major factor affecting the limited stability of MOFs. The trend of metal-ligand bond strength is in line with the hard soft acid base principle. The water stability of MOF adsorbents could be achieved by regulating the hydrophobicity of the framework, especially by embedding the hydrophobic group into the organic linkers, such as methyl groups. Nowadays, the development of stable MOF materials, especially water- or humid-stable, is highly desired in the industrial practical implementation.
  </p>
  <p>
   Herein, we report a two-dimensional (2D) Cu-MOF, NUM-11 ([Cu(Hmpba)2] 1.5DMF), which possesses excellent stability in water, organic solvents, and a wide pH range. This MOF was constructed by a Cu(II) salt and a N,O-containing organic ligand based on the principle of hard soft acid base, and the strong hydrophobicity is mainly due to the methyl group on the organic linker. The gas separation performance of NUM-11a (activated NUM-11) shows selectivity toward C2H2, which could efficiently separate C2H2 from C2H2/C2H4, C2H2/CO2, and C2H2/C2H4/CO2 mixtures. The adsorption ability for C2H2, C2H4, and CO2 was evaluated by single-component gas adsorption isotherms, and the selectivity toward C2H2 was proven by the heat of adsorption. The separation performances of C2H2 from C2H2/C2H4, C2H2/CO2, and C2H2/C2H4/CO2 mixtures were confirmed by IAST selectivity calculations and transient column breakthrough experiments. The mechanism of C2H2 purification was visually explained by Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations. Furthermore, the low adsorption heat and good cycling stability indicated its promising candidate adsorbents for the actual separation of C2H2 from C2H2/C2H4, C2H2/CO2, and C2H2/C2H4/CO2 mixtures in industrial implementation.

  <p>
   Various chemical reagents and solvents used in this work were obtained from commercial suppliers and used directly without further purification. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data were gathered on a Rigaku Miniflex 600 at 40 kV and 15 mA using Cu-Kα radiation in an air atmosphere at a scan rate of 5.0 deg min-1. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were performed on a Rigaku standard TG-DTA analyzer from room temperature to 800 °C under an air atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 °C min-1 using an empty and clean Al2O3 crucible as a reference. In situ variable temperature PXRD (VT-PXRD) patterns were collected on a Bruker D8 diffractometer. The surface morphology of the samples was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (JOEL JSM-7800F).

   Synthesis of NUM-11
  </h2>
  <p>
   A mixture of Cu(NO3)2 3H2O (0.15 g), 4-(3,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)benzoic acid (H2mpba) (0.05 g), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) (10 mL), and H2O (10 mL) was placed in a 50 mL screw-capped glass vial, and the suspension became homogeneous by sonicating; then, the glass vial was capped and heated in an oven at 353 K for 12 h. After it was cooled naturally to room temperature, violet rectangular block crystals were obtained and washed several times with DMF to afford NUM-11 (yield: about 72% based on H2mpba) (CCDC number: 2142649). The desolvated sample used for gas adsorption measurement was prepared by a methanol-exchanged sample followed by activation under ultrahigh vacuum conditions at 150 °C for 8 h.

   Single-Component Gas Adsorption Measurements
  </h2>
  <p>
   N2 sorption measurements were performed at 77 K with a liquid nitrogen bath using a Micrometrics ASAP 2460 volumetric gas adsorption analyzer in a pressure range from 0 to 1.1 bar. The sorption isotherms of C2H2, C2H4, and CO2 were measured at different temperatures (278, 288, and 298 K) controlled with a circulating water bath (Julabo F12) through a fully automatic gas adsorption analyzer (Micromeritics, ASAP 2020 HD88). The gases used for sorption measurements were provided with ultrahigh purities.

  <h2>
   GCMC Simulations
  </h2>
  <p>
   The GCMC simulations were carried out for the adsorption of C2H2, C2H4, and CO2 in NUM-11a using the sorption module in Materials Studio. The skeleton of NUM-11a and gas molecules were regarded as rigid bodies. The optimal adsorption sites were simulated under 298 K and 1.0 bar by the fixed loading task and Metropolis method. The loading steps, equilibration steps, and production steps were all set to 5.0 × 106. The gas-skeleton interaction and the gas-gas interaction were characterized by the standard universal force field (UFF). The atomic partial charges of the host skeleton of NUM-11a were obtained from DDEC calculations. (27,28) The cutoff radius used for the Lennard-Jones interactions was 15.5 Å.

   Results and Discussion
  </h2>
  <p>
   The reaction of H2mpba and Cu(NO3)2 3H2O under solvothermal conditions produced a porous framework NUM-11 (Figure 1). In the MOF, Cu2+ in the metal center adopts a planar four-coordination mode, which is coordinated with pyrazole groups (with two N atoms) and two carboxylate groups (with two O atoms) (Figure S1), generating a two-dimensional square lattice (sql) coordination framework (Figure 1b,c and Figure S2). The layered network structure is further stacked together through π-π interactions (Figure 1d and Figure S3). The MOF material has been fully characterized by PXRD, scanning electron microscopy, in situ VT-PXRD, and thermogravimetric analysis. The synthesized bulk sample phase purity was confirmed by comparing the experimental PXRD pattern with the simulated one exported from the single crystal structure data (Figure S4). The filled guest solvents in the pore channels can be completely removed through vacuum heating at 150 °C for 8 h, getting the desolvated sample. This desolvated sample has the same structure as NUM-11. (29) After the free DMF guest molecules in the channel were removed from the as-synthesized sample, the desolvated material shows a similar PXRD pattern to the as-synthesized one, which verifies the stability upon guest loss (Figure S5). In addition, the desolvated MOF exhibits a one-dimensional (1D) channel with a pore size of approximately 5.7 × 6.3 Å2 along the a-axis.
  </p>
  <p>
   The scanning electron microscopy image presented in Figure 2a distinctly exhibits the rectangular block morphology of NUM-11 crystals. From the optical microscopy image (Figure 2b), it is confirmed that this MOF with violet cubic shape was well-crystallized. According to the hard soft acid base principle, NUM-11 was constructed by the Cu2+ node and N,O-containing organic linker, which may show modest thermal stability. Then, the thermal stability of NUM-11 was first proven by TGA and VT-PXRD (Figure 2c,d). The thermogravimetric curve and VT-PXRD patterns exhibit that NUM-11 can maintain the framework structure up to approximately 320 °C, and the results of VT-PXRD were consistent well with the TG curve. Since the methyl group is embedded on the ligand, then water stability is elaboratively studied. As shown in Figure 2e,f, NUM-11 shows good stability in aqueous solution with a wide pH range and different temperatures. Due to the synergistic effect of the hard soft acid base principle and methyl functional group, NUM-11 is an excellent water-stable candidate MOF adsorbent. The excellent chemical and thermal stabilities and especially water stability, which is extremely desired, make this MOF material practically available.
  </p>
  <p>
   Prior to single-component gas adsorption experiments, NUM-11 was activated by heating the methanol-exchanged sample to 423 K for 8 h under a high vacuum atmosphere ( < 10-5 torr) to obtain the desolvated sample NUM-11a. The PXRD pattern of the desolvated sample indicated that the framework architecture of this MOF can be maintained. The permanent porosity of NUM-11a was assessed by N2 adsorption at 77 K and CO2 adsorption at 195 K. The single-component gas adsorption capacities of N2 and CO2 for NUM-11a are 11.24 and 88.70 cm3 g-1, respectively (Figure 3a). The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of NUM-11a was determined to be 374.2 m2 g-1 based on the CO2 adsorption isotherm at 195 K. Apparently, no considerable uptake amount is observed in the N2 sorption isotherms at 77 K, probably owing to the strong host-guest interactions between the N2 guest molecule and the channel windows, blocking N2 diffusion into the MOF, and the low kinetic energy of N2. (30-32)
  </p>
  <p>
   Motivated by the stable structure, the gas adsorption and separation behavior of NUM-11a was explored. First, the low pressure pure-component gas adsorption isotherms for C2H2, C2H4, and CO2 at different temperatures (278, 288, and 298 K) were measured. As shown in Figure 3b-d, the adsorption capacity of C2H2 on NUM-11a is obviously higher than those of C2H4 and CO2. Specifically, the uptake amounts of C2H2, C2H4, and CO2 for NUM-11a are 50.51, 35.85, and 28.42 cm3 g-1 at 298 K and 1.0 bar, which represents that C2H2 is more preferentially adsorbed than C2H4 and CO2 in the ultramicroporous channels. In short, the adsorption capacity of C2H2 (2.25 mmol g-1) is modest for NUM-11a at 298 K and 1.0 bar, higher than or comparable to many well-known MOFs, such as Cu-FINA-2 (approximately 1.79 mmol g-1), (33) CPL-1 (1.84 mmol g-1) and CPL-1-NH2 (2.01 mmol g-1), (34) M'MOF-3a (1.90 mmol g-1), (35) UiO-66-(COOH)2 (2.16 mmol g-1), (36) JNU-1 (2.67 mmol g-1), (37) Ni3(pzdc)2(7Hade)2 (2.36 mmol g-1), (38) NKMOF-1-Cu (2.27 mmol g-1), (8) and CuI@UiO-66-(COOH)2 (2.31 mmol g-1). (36)NUM-11a shows relatively small CO2 adsorption amounts (1.27 mmol g-1) under the same situations, resulting in a well C2H2/CO2 uptake ration of 1.78, higher than or comparable to those of UiO-66-(COOH)2 (1.29), (36) JNU-2 (2.1), (39) etc. In addition, the small adsorption amount for C2H4 also causes a modest C2H2/C2H4 uptake ratio of 1.3, comparable to that of NKMOF-1-Ni (1.28), (8) FeMOF-74 (1.11), (40) and NOTT-300 (1.48). (41) The single-component gas adsorption performance shows that the strong C2H2 binding affinity in NUM-11a is promising to be used for separation of C2H2 from mixtures containing CO2 and C2H4. Based on this kind of gas adsorption behavior, we focused on the separation potential of C2H2/CO2, C2H2/C2H4, and C2H2/C2H4/CO2 mixtures because of their practical application relevance.
  </p>
  <p>
   In order to evaluate the host-guest interactions between the framework and guest molecules, the coverage-dependent isosteric adsorption heats (Qst) of NUM-11a for C2H2, C2H4, and CO2 were calculated by a virial equation method using the single-component adsorption data collected at 278 and 288 K. As shown in Figure 4a, the Qst value of C2H2 on NUM-11a at zero-loading was 18.24 kJ mol-1, whereas the Qst values for C2H4 and CO2 were 17.99 and 16.14 kJ mol-1, respectively. The higher Qst value indicates a strong binding affinity toward C2H2 over C2H4 and CO2 on NUM-11a. In addition, the result of Qst agrees well with the tendency of adsorption performance, which proves once again the feasibility for the separation of C2H2 from the C2H2/CO2, C2H2/C2H4, and C2H2/C2H4/CO2 mixtures. Notably, the Qst value for C2H2 is lower than those of previously reported MOFs such as CPL-1-NH2 (50 kJ mmol-1), (34) NKMOF-1-Ni (60.3 kJ mmol-1), (8) TIFSIX-2-Ni-i (40 kJ mmol-1), (42) F-PYMO-Cu (35.9 kJ mmol-1), CuI@UiO-66-(COOH)2 (74.5 kJ mmol-1), (36) FeNi-M'MOF (27-32.8 kJ mmol-1), (40) SIFSIX-Cu-TPA (39.1 kJ mmol-1), (43) sql-SIFSIX-bpe-Zn (67.5 kJ mmol-1), (44) and UTSA-74a (31 kJ mmol-1) (45) (Figure 4e). Such a low adsorption enthalpy for C2H2 not only implies the feasibility to easily regenerate the MOF material under mild conditions but also suggests the lower energy footprints consumed in the regeneration of the MOF.
  </p>
  <p>
   Inspired by the distinct adsorption interaction differences in C2H2, CO2, and C2H4 toward the 2D stable MOF material, NUM-11a has promising potential for efficient separation of C2H2 from C2H2/C2H4 and C2H2/CO2 mixtures. The separation capacity toward C2H2/C2H4 and C2H2/CO2 was evaluated in light of the ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) method. The detailed calculation of adsorption selectivity using the IAST theory is shown in the Supporting Information. As shown in Figure 4b-d, the calculated selectivity values of C2H2/C2H4 (1/99, v/v) and C2H2/CO2 (50/50, v/v) mixtures, whose composition is close to actual industrial mixtures, are 1.65 and 3.00, respectively. Compared with some reported MOFs, the selectivity value of C2H2/CO2 (50/50) is higher than that of some MOFs including UPC-200(M)-R-L series (1.89-2.25), (23) SNNU-27-M (1.0-2.0), (46) etc. In addition, the C2H2/C2H4 (1/99) selectivity value is higher than or comparable to those of NPU-1 (1.4) and NPU-2 (1.25). (47) These endow the C2H2 purification with proficiency for NUM-11a. Continuous CO2 adsorption/desorption experiments on NUM-11a were carried out to evaluate its cycling stability. After five cycles, NUM-11a shows no obvious reduction in its CO2 adsorption capacities (Figure 4f).
  </p>
  <p>
   In order to appraise the practicable separation of C2H2 from the mixtures containing C2H4 and CO2 for NUM-11a, transient breakthrough simulations were conducted for the separation of C2H2/C2H4 (10/90 and 50/50, v/v), C2H2/CO2 (50/50, v/v), and equimolar C2H2/C2H4/CO2 mixtures in a fixed-bed utilizing a pressure swing adsorption operation at 298 K. As shown in Figure 5, a function of the dimensionless time, τ, in the transient breakthrough can be used to illustrate the separation performance. Due to the stronger interactions between C2H2 molecules and the framework than those of C2H4 and CO2, C2H4 and CO2 first eluted out from the column at the beginning of the experiment, while C2H2 was still adsorbed. This series of breakthrough curves confirm that NUM-11a could be a good candidate for the separation of C2H2 from C2H4 and CO2.
  </p>
  <p>
   The differences in gas adsorption capacity and isosteric adsorption heat among C2H2, CO2, and C2H4 suggest the potential of NUM-11a for the separation of C2H2 from C2H2/CO2, C2H2/C2H4, and C2H2/C2H4/CO2 mixtures. In order to gain profound insights into the adsorption behavior and visually understand the host-guest interactions between the framework and the guest molecules, we performed detailed theoretical investigations using GCMC simulations to investigate the adsorption density distribution and possible binding sites of C2H2, CO2, and C2H4. As shown in Figure 6, in light of the adsorption density distribution, the favorable adsorption sites of C2H2, C2H4, and CO2 were distributed at the corner near the aromatic rings and the methyl groups. The results of the possible binding sites reveal that the probable binding site for C2H2 is located between two adjacent benzene rings and C2H2 interacts with the framework through forming three C-H C (3.118-3.334 Å), one C-H O (3.356 Å), and two C-H π (3.232-3.306 Å) interactions (Figure 6a,b). Similar to C2H2, C2H4 also interacts with the framework through forming three C-H C (3.348-3.432 Å), one C-H O (3.359 Å), and two C-H π (3.260-3.266 Å) interactions, while the distance is longer (Figure 6c,d). CO2 interacts with the framework through forming four C-H O (3.105-3.616 Å) interactions (Figure 6e,f). As a result, C2H2 interacts much stronger with the framework than CO2 and C2H4, mainly because of the superposition of multiple weak interactions. Therefore, it could be inferred from the above discussion that the strong interaction drives the high C2H2 binding affinity and decent purification capacity of C2H2. These theoretical calculation results are consistent well with the experimental phenomena.

   Conclusions
  </h2>
  <p>
   In summary, we have investigated the use of a N,O-containing organic linker to construct a two-dimensional MOF NUM-11, with ultrahigh water stability, featuring a simple sql topology and rhombic pores, for the separation of C2H2 from C2H4 and CO2. With the advantages of stable framework, decent single-component gas adsorption behavior and C2H2/CO2, C2H2/C2H4, and C2H2/C2H4/CO2 separation performance, low adsorption enthalpy, good regeneration properties, and outstanding recycle ability, NUM-11a is considered to be a promising candidate for critical industrial applications. In addition, the mechanism over the selectivity adsorption/separation from the molecular level is visually revealed by GCMC simulations. This work not only reports a stable MOF for the C2H2/CO2, C2H2/C2H4, and C2H2/C2H4/CO2 separation but also provides guidance for the synthesis of stable MOFs, making use of the synergistic effect of the hard soft acid base principle and protective groups.
