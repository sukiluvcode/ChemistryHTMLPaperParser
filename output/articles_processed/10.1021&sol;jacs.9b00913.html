   High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideThe separation of ethane from ethylene is of prime importance in the purification of chemical feedstocks for industrial manufacturing. However, differentiating these compounds is notoriously difficult due to their similar physicochemical properties. High-performance porous adsorbents provide a solution. Conventional adsorbents trap ethylene in preference to ethane, but this incurs multiple steps in separation processes. Alternatively, high-purity ethylene can be obtained in a single step if the adsorbent preferentially adsorbs ethane over ethylene. We herein report a metal-organic framework, MUF-15 (MUF, Massey University Framework), constructed from inexpensive precursors that sequesters ethane from ethane/ethylene mixtures. The productivity of this material is exceptional: 1 kg of MOF produces 14 L of polymer-grade ethylene gas in a single adsorption step starting from an equimolar ethane/ethylene mixture. Computational simulations illustrate the underlying mechanism of guest adsorption. The separation performance was assessed by measuring multicomponent breakthrough curves, which illustrate that the separation performance is maintained over a wide range of feed compositions and operating pressures. MUF-15 is robust, maintains its performance in the presence of acetylene, and is easily regenerated by purging with inert gas or by placing under reduced pressure.

   Introduction
  </h2>
  <p>
   Ethylene is one of the most important feedstocks for the production of polymers and high-value organic chemicals. (1) It is usually produced by the thermal cracking of hydrocarbons. The removal of ethane byproducts that inevitably arise during these processes is one of the most challenging chemical separations due to the similarity of the physicochemical properties of ethane and ethylene. (2-4) At present, cryogenic distillation is the main technology used to separate these compounds. This process is expensive and comes with a high energy penalty because of the requirement for high pressures and low temperatures (typically at 5-28 bar and 180-258 K using over 100 trays). (5,6) To avoid such a high consumption of energy, more efficient separation technologies at ambient conditions are highly sought after. (7-9) Among techniques with lower energy requirements and operating costs, adsorptive separation processes using porous solid materials have risen to prominence. (10-13) Although conventional porous materials such as zeolites and carbon-based materials have been applied for hydrocarbon separations, in general they are not satisfactory in separation processes due to poor adsorption selectivity and low capacity. (14-16) Thanks to their high pore volumes, designable pore characteristics, and countless structural possibilities, novel metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are prime adsorbents. (17-20) MOFs are of increasing importance in the context of hydrocarbon separation, especially the separation of ethylene from ethane. (21-25)
  </p>
  <p>
   MOFs differ widely in their relative affinities for ethane (C2H6) and ethylene (C2H4). (22,26,27) The design strategy for MOFs that prefer C2H4 is comparatively straightforward and relies on introducing open metal sites or highly polar groups into the framework. (21,28-31) This approach takes advantage of the larger quadrupole moment of C2H4 and the presence of π electrons, which render it capable of coordinating to metals. In contrast, for ethane-selective MOFs, the dominant interactions can be ascribed to dispersion and induction forces as ethane has a higher polarizability than ethylene. Therefore, a MOF with a pore structure enriched with nonpolar surfaces and pore dimensions that match the size of C2H6 may favor the preferential adsorption of this adsorbate.
  </p>
  <p>
   The implementation of C2H4-selective MOFs has two significant disadvantages. First, water vapor is liable to diminish the affinity of the adsorbent for C2H4 because it will compete for the same highly polar sites. Second, these adsorbents require an additional desorption step to yield the C2H4-rich product stream in a C2H6/C2H4 separation process, which typically involves a purge gas and high temperatures or the application of a vacuum. In addition, due to the contamination of eluent by adsorbed C2H6 during this desorption step, further purification is demanded to reach the >99.95% purity required by C2H4 polymerization reactors. (29,32,33) On the other hand, the efficiency of C2H6-selective MOFs is significantly greater because high-purity C2H4 is afforded directly through a single adsorption step, simplifying the process and resulting in an increase in productivity. (22,34) Such an efficient approach offers energy savings of 40% in pressure/temperature swing adsorbent technologies for this separation. (35,36) Despite these advantages, only a few such C2H6-selective MOFs have been identified so far, and they suffer from either poor selectivity because of the difficulty in discriminating C2H6 and C2H4 (34,37-42) or low C2H6 uptake due to moderate pore volumes. (22,43-45)
  </p>
  <p>
   Low selectivities result in a reduced purification efficiency of C2H4, and reduced pore volumes are antagonistic to productivity. Hence, fabricating adsorbents that combine good selectivity with high uptake capacity is of special interest. (46) Recently, Chen et al. reported an impressive MOF showing strong affinity toward ethane within channels of [Fe2(O2)(dobdc)]. (47) Although [Fe2(O2)(dobdc)] exhibits good selectivity and ethane capacity, it suffers from a high energy penalty during regeneration (Qst = -66.8 kJ/mol). Moreover, this material is not stable in air and requires special handling under inert conditions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Herein, we present the synthesis, structure, and gas separation performance of a C2H6-selective MOF termed MUF-15 (MUF = Massey University Framework). Owing to its relatively high pore volume, MUF-15 exhibits the highest C2H6 uptake among top-performing ethane-selective MOFs. Moreover, it features relatively small pores that are decorated by benzene rings to facilitate close contacts between ethane guests and the framework walls. This unique pore architecture results in a C2H6/C2H4 selectivity of two. On account of this remarkable uptake and good selectivity, MUF-15 exhibits a remarkable productivity: 1 kg of this MOF produces 14 L of C2H4 in a single adsorption cycle starting from an equimolar C2H4/C2H6 mixture. Furthermore, MUF-15 can be synthesized in a straightforward way using inexpensive precursors, is robust and easily handled, can be easily regenerated and recycled without further loss in separation performance, and maintains its preference for ethane in the presence of acetylene.

   Results and Discussion
  </h2>
  <p>
   The solvothermal reaction of cobalt acetate and isophthalic acid (H2ipa) in a water/methanol mixture yields violet plate-like single crystals of MUF-15, [Co3(μ3-OH)(ipa)2.5(H2O)]. MUF-15 is built up from inexpensive precursors and formed in a high yield. Based on commercial prices, we estimate the raw material cost of this compound is less than $20 per kg. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction revealed that MUF-15 crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Pnna (Table S1). As observed in a related CoII-isophthalate material (termed OMOF-2 here), (48) MUF-15 is assembled from a hexacobalt cluster connected by 10 ipa linkers (Figure 1a). The cluster nodes are built up from two symmetry-related sets of three cobalt(II) ions. The ions within each set coordinate to a μ3-bridging hydroxide ion, and the two sets are connected to each other through shared carboxylate groups. There is one terminal H2O ligand per set of three cobalt ions, which is disordered over two sites. By considering the cobalt clusters as 10-connected nodes linked by ipa ligands (Figure 1c), MUF-15 can be depicted as a porous coordination polymer. The framework defines three narrow zigzag 1-dimensional pores that intersect each other, as highlighted in Figure 1d and 1e. These orthogonal channels run along the a, b, and c axes with pore-limiting windows of 8.5 × 3.5, 7 × 3.8, and 3.2 × 1.2 Å, respectively (Figure S7).
  </p>
  <p>
   Guest-free MUF-15 can be readily produced at 120 °C under vacuum, which preserves the coordinated water molecules. These water ligands are lost, together with the crystallinity and porosity, by heating above 200 °C. The phase purity of the material activated at 120 °C was confirmed by matching its powder X-ray diffraction pattern with that simulated from its SCXRD structure (Figure S4), by analysis of the 1H NMR spectrum of a digested sample (Figure S2), and by elemental analysis. Thermogravimetry and powder XRD demonstrated that MUF-15 decomposes above 400 °C under nitrogen (Figure S5), while it is stable when exposed to a laboratory atmosphere ( ~ 80% humidity) at ambient temperatures for at least 1 week (Figure S4). A N2 adsorption isotherm at 77 K illustrated the permanent porosity of MUF-15 and gave a BET surface area of 1130 m2/g and a pore volume of 0.51 cm3/g (Figure S19). These values are nearly identical to the geometric surface area of 1260 m2/g and pore volume of 0.46 cm3/g calculated from the crystallographic coordinates (Table S2).
  </p>
  <p>
   The accessible surface of the MUF-15 channels is largely defined by the phenyl rings of the ipa ligands. Together with the pore dimensions, this surface chemistry signals promise for the capture of the more polarizable ethane in preference to ethylene. Single-component C2H6 and C2H4 adsorption isotherms were measured on guest-free MUF-15 at 293 K (Figure 2a) and other temperatures (Figures S8 and S9). These isotherms exhibit type I character with a smooth increase with pressure and full reversibility. Importantly, the isotherms can be reproduced over multiple cycles (Figure S13) and remain identical after exposing a sample to a laboratory atmosphere overnight. MUF-15 has a distinct preference for adsorbing ethane over ethylene: the uptake reaches 4.69 mmol/g (105 cm3/g) and 4.15 (93 cm3/g) for C2H6 and C2H4, respectively, at 293 K and 1 bar. Since the uptake kinetics of the two gases are nearly identical (Figure S15), this can be ascribed to a thermodynamic effect. The C2H6 uptake capacity of MUF-15 at 1 bar (4.69 mmol/g) is notably higher than that of the benchmark adsorbents Cu(Qc)2 (1.85 mmol/g), (45) ZIF-7 (1.85 mmol/g), (43) and MAF-49 (1.73 mmol/g). (22) This stems from its large pore volume (0.51 cm3/g) compared to that of Cu(Qc)2 (0.11 cm3/g), (45) ZIF-7 (0.078 cm3/g), (49) and MAF-49 (0.2 cm3/g; calculated by RASPA2 simulation software using a helium probe).
  </p>

   There is frequently a trade-off between pore dimensions and pore volumes in adsorbent materials. Pore dimensions on par with small guest molecules often correlate with small pore volumes, which in turn lead to low uptake capacities. On the other hand, high pore volumes usually arise from large pores which cannot discriminate between molecules of similar sizes. However, the topological features of MUF-15 embody a rare combination of voluminous pores and wall-to-wall distances on par with small guest molecules. This allows it to simultaneously adsorb a significant quantity of ethane and discriminate it from ethylene.
  </p>
  <p>
   Coverage-dependent adsorption enthalpies (Qst) of MUF-15 for C2H6 and C2H4 were evaluated experimentally from pure component isotherms collected at 288, 293, and 298 K by the implementation of a virial equation (Figure 2b). The resultant Qst at near-zero coverage is 29.2 and 28.2 kJ/mol for C2H6 and C2H4, respectively, which underscores the enhanced uptake of C2H6. At higher coverage, the Qst values rise for both gases, with the increase for C2H6 being markedly steeper. This implies that the adsorption process benefits from intermolecular interactions among the adsorbates, which is fully consistent with the crystallographically observed pore dimensions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Motivated by the high uptake and preferential binding of ethane by MUF-15, the adsorption selectivity of C2H6/C2H4 mixtures was predicted on the basis of ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) (50) using a range of starting compositions (50/50, 25/75, and 10/90 C2H6/C2H4, Figures 2c and Figures S30 and S31). MUF-15 exhibits a C2H6/C2H4 selectivity of around two for all three mixtures. Achieving this combination of good selectivity and high capacity is rare in an adsorbent material. Previously reported ethane-selective MOFs typically exhibit either very low gas uptakes or poor selectivity (Figure 3d and Table S5). (22,38,39,41,43,44)
  </p>
  <p>
   First-principles dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT-D3) (51) calculations as implemented in the software package VASP (52) were performed to gain further insight into the mechanism of selective C2H6/C2H4 adsorption in MUF-15. The calculated static binding energy for C2H6 at its most preferred binding site is around -36.7 kJ/mol, whereas it is -35.0 kJ/mol for C2H4. The stronger host-guest interactions with ethane are in accord with experimental observations. This can be attributed to van der Waals interactions between the ethane and the neighboring π electron clouds. As shown in Figure 3a and 3b, based on DFT calculations, the C2H6 molecules are bound in a pocket defined by four phenyl rings. C-H π interactions exist between the C2H6 molecule and the phenyl rings within the cavity. Although C-H π interactions are dominated by dispersion, as compared to other noncovalent interactions involving permanent dipoles/quadrupoles, the cavity of MUF-15 complements the size of the C2H6 molecule to enable C-H π interactions between all six hydrogens of C2H6 and three adjacent phenyl rings. In contrast, the C2H4 molecule shows short contacts only with two parallel edges of the cavity. Thus, its lower binding energy can be attributed to the lack of strong permanent dipoles on the framework and the reduced number of C-H π interactions. Besides the number of C-H π interactions, C2H6 as a more polarizable molecule can interact more strongly by induced dipole interactions with the framework compared to the less polarizable C2H4 molecule.

   The gas adsorption mechanism in MUF-15 was further verified by the adsorption behavior of acetylene. C2H2 is another guest molecule from the C2 hydrocarbons family which has relatively high polarity and low polarizability (Table S3). Adsorption isotherms of C2H2 for MUF-15 were measured, and MUF-15 adsorbs less C2H2 than both C2H4 and C2H6 at low pressure (Figure S12). A subsequent calculation revealed that the heat of adsorption of C2H2 (27.5 kJ/mol) is less than that of C2H4 and C2H6 (28.2 and 29.2 kJ/mol, respectively). This lower affinity for C2H2 is consistent with a guest binding mechanism that relies primarily on van der Waals interactions rather than on permanent electric dipoles/quadrupoles, as uncovered by the DFT calculations above. To the best of our knowledge, MUF-15 is the first material to be reported that exhibits the selective adsorption of C2H6 over both C2H4 and C2H2. It is atypical for a porous material to display the "reverse" selectivity exhibited by MUF-15 given the propensity of the permanent dipole/quadrupole moments to dominate strong adsorption processes.

   Building on these results, we then demonstrated the feasibility of using MUF-15 for C2H6/C2H4 separations under the dynamic conditions encountered in industrial processes. Breakthrough measurements using a fixed adsorbent bed containing ~1 g of MUF-15 were conducted at room temperature. C2H6/C2H4 mixtures of 50/50, 25/75, and 10/90 were used as feeds to mimic a range of industrial process conditions (Figure 3c and Figures S38 and S42). C2H4 eluted through the bed first to yield an outflow of pure gas. Conversely, because C2H6 is more efficiently adsorbed by the MUF-15 bed, it breaks through following a substantial time lapse. These results indicate that MUF-15 can efficiently trap C2H6 to yield pure C2H4. The separation performance of MUF-15 was quantified in terms of its productivity for comparison with other high-performance C2H6-selective MOFs. The productivity of these adsorbents is defined as the quantity of ethylene with a purity in excess of 99.95% produced per unit mass of adsorbent starting from an equimolar ethane/ethylene mixture. (22,45) Productivity was calculated based on both experimental and simulated breakthrough curves for MUF-15 and materials previously reported in the literature (Table S5). MUF-15 possesses a productivity of 14 L of polymer-grade ethylene gas per kilogram of material with a single adsorption step, which exceeds that of other top-performing ethane-selective MOFs such as MAF-49 (22) (5.3 L/kg), Cu(Qc)2 (45) (4.3 L/kg), IRMOF-8 (34) (2.5 L/kg), and PCN-250 (40) (10 L/kg) but trails the recently reported MOF [Fe2(O2)(dobdc)] (47) (19.3 L/kg).
  </p>
  <p>
   In isolation, neither high uptake nor good selectivity is sufficient for highly productive MOFs. Both attributes are required in tandem, but they are seldom simultaneously combined in the same material. Relative to other materials, MUF-15 benefits from particularly good uptake. As highlighted in Figure 3d, the uptake of ethane from a 50/50 mixture of ethane and ethylene at 1 bar (ethane uptakemix) calculated for MUF-15 exceeds that of other known ethane-selective adsorbents. This results in a longer period of time during which pure C2H4 can be obtained from the column outlet, i.e.. it underpins the excellent productivity of MUF-15 (Table S5). Looking ahead, since improvements in selectivity tend to come associated with costs relating to regeneration and instability, high-performance materials that can operate under realistic operating conditions in the future will likely arise from further enhancements in ethane capacity.
  </p>
  <p>
   To investigate separations at low C2H6 concentrations and higher operating pressures, we simulated breakthrough curves under these conditions. First, a reliable mass transfer coefficient for the simulated breakthrough curves was estimated from experimental data (see ESI section 8). Upon optimization, this coefficient leads to an excellent match between simulated and experimental breakthrough curves. We subsequently predicted breakthrough curves using feed compositions of 1/99 and 0.1/99.9 C2H6/C2H4 (Figure 3f and Figure S51). These calculations revealed that MUF-15 is capable of eliminating trace quantities of C2H6 from C2H4, as often required in industrial settings, and we anticipate that this result could be verified experimentally. To investigate the performance of MUF-15 at higher pressure, as required by pressure-swing adsorption processes, breakthrough curves were predicted at different pressures. First, isotherms of C2H6 and C2H4 were measured at 298 K up to 10 bar (Figure S17). From IAST calculations for a 25/75 C2H6/C2H4 mixture (Figure S34) at 10 bar, we found that MUF-15 maintains its preferential adsorption of C2H6 over C2H4 with a selectivity of 1.79. This selectivity result was then used to predict breakthrough curves of C2H6 and C2H4 across a range of elevated pressures (Figure 4). These predicted breakthrough curves demonstrate that MUF-15 is capable of removing C2H6 from C2H4 at high pressures under dynamic conditions. This is notable since productivity gains arise from working at higher pressures. For example, the productivity of MUF-15 nearly doubles in going from atmospheric pressure to 20 bar (Figure S55).
  </p>
  <p>
   To enable economical deployment in industrial settings, the adsorbent should also possess good regenerability and structural stability. To test the recyclability of MUF-15, breakthrough separation experiments were cycled numerous times (Figure 3e). The experimental cycling results indicate that there was no noticeable loss in the C2H6 adsorption and separation capacity for MUF-15 over 12 cycles. The regenerability of MUF-15 was also investigated by either placing it under vacuum or purging with an inert gas. The framework can be fully regenerated between cycles in this manner, specifically by placing it under vacuum for around 10-15 min or by purging with helium at 70 °C and 1.1 bar (Figure S43).
  </p>
  <h2>
   Conclusion
  </h2>
  <p>
   MUF-15 is capable of producing pure C2H4 by selectively adsorbing C2H6 under ambient conditions. Owing to its high selectivity and excellent uptake, MUF-15 possesses one of the highest productivities among materials that exhibit reverse selectivity, the sought-after characteristic of preferentially adsorbing C2H6 over C2H4. Underlying this C2H6 selectivity are (i) pore dimensions that induce optimal van der Waals interactions between the guest and the framework surface and (ii) the avoidance of built-in regions of high polarity, such as open metal sites. Additional benefits from these features include stability to laboratory atmospheres and water vapor. Furthermore, due to its moderate heat of adsorption, MUF-15 can be easily regenerated by purging at moderate temperatures or in vacuo over a short period of time. Combined with its robust nature, this allows MUF-15 to be recycled for repeated separation cycles without any loss of performance. MUF-15 is readily synthesized from simple and inexpensive reagents. Taken together, these attributes represent a significant addition to the portfolio of known C2H6-selective MOFs. By providing a clear illustration of how such selectivity may be achieved using straightforward components, this framework defines the way forward for challenging separations.
