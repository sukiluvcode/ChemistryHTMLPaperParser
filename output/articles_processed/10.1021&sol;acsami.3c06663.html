   High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideRecovering light alkanes from natural gas is a critical but challenging process in petrochemical production. Herein, we propose a postmodification strategy via simultaneous metal/ligand exchange to prepare multivariate metal-organic frameworks with enhanced capacity and selectivity of ethane (C2H6) and propane (C3H8) for their recovery from natural gas with methane (CH4) as the primary component. By utilizing the Kuratowski-type secondary building unit of CFA-1 as a scaffold, namely, {Zn5(OAc)4}6+, the Zn2+ metal ions and OAc- ligands were simultaneously exchanged by other transition metal ions and halogen ligands under mild conditions. Inspiringly, this postmodification treatment can give rise to improved capacity for C2H6 and C3H8 without a noticeable increase in CH4 uptake, and consequently, it resulted in significantly enhanced selectivity toward C2H6/CH4 and C3H8/CH4. In particular, by adjusting the species and amount of the modulator, the optimal sample CFA-1-NiCl2-2.3 demonstrated the maximum capacities of C2H6 (5.00 mmol/g) and C3H8 (8.59 mmol/g), increased by 29 and 32% compared to that of CFA-1. Moreover, this compound exhibited excellent separation performance toward C2H6/CH4 and C3H8/CH4, with high uptake ratios of 6.9 and 11.9 at 298 K and 1 bar, respectively, superior to the performance of a majority of the reported MOFs. Molecular simulations were applied to unravel the improved separation mechanism of CFA-1-NiCl2-2.3 toward C2H6/CH4 and C3H8/CH4. Furthermore, remarkable thermal/chemical robustness, moderate isosteric heat, and fully reproducible breakthrough experiments were confirmed on CFA-1-NiCl2-2.3, indicating its great potential for light alkane recovery from natural gas.

   1. Introduction
  </h2>
  <p>
   Natural gas, with methane (CH4) as the primary component, is a widely used energy fuel exhibiting various advantages, including low cost, environmental friendliness, and abundance in nature. (1,2) Besides CH4, a considerable amount of ethane (C2H6) and propane (C3H8) exist in the crude stream, which are essential chemicals and can be employed to produce ethylene (C2H4) and propylene (C3H6), the raw materials for various chemicals and polymers. (3) Hence, to further utilize C2H6 and C3H8 in raw natural gas as valuable industrial feedstocks, efficient C2-C3 selective recovery from natural gas is of vital importance. (4,5) Among the industrial separation methods for light hydrocarbons, cryogenic distillation is the dominant separation technology depending on the volatility difference of each component, whereas the process consumes a significant proportion of energy. (6) Propitiously, selective adsorption using porous materials under mild operational conditions offers a more energy-efficient and cost-effective alternative for light hydrocarbon separations, if the adsorbents possess excellent selectivity and capacity toward target guest molecules as well as sufficient stability. (7-10)
  </p>
  <p>
   Emerging as a prominent class of porous materials, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are showing remarkable gas separation and purification prospects, beneficial from their high porosity, tunable and uniform pore size, and controllable surface chemistry. (5,11,12) So far, encouraging progress has been made, and some MOFs have proven effective for recovery of C3H8 and C2H6 from natural gas. For instance, the MOF-74 analogues and HKUST-1 with a high density of open metal sites showed stronger affinities with C2H6 and C3H8 than CH4, endowing them with efficient separation capability for C3H8/CH4 and C2H6/CH4 mixtures. (13-16) However, their vulnerability upon exposure to moist air will significantly hinder their practical applications. Some MOFs with large pore volumes, such as UiO-67, PCN-224, and CTGU-15, (2,17,18) were reported for the separation of C3H8/C2H6/CH4. However, their C2H6 uptake and selectivity toward C2H6/CH4 were usually low to moderate at ambient conditions (usually <3 mmol/g at 298 K and 1 bar), as a result of weaker affinity toward C2H6 in the relatively larger pore sizes. In addition, a few MOFs with ultramicropore structures were reported to have a higher selectivity of C2H6 and C3H8 from CH4 due to the confinement effect. However, their uptakes for C2H6 and/or C3H8 at ambient conditions might be limited due to lower porosity, e.g.. SBMOF-1 and Zr-FUM. (19,20) Aside from developing new MOF structures, modification of the MOF structures provides a valuable strategy to improve their separation performance, which can be divided into presynthetic design and postsynthetic modification. (21-23) For the former strategy, introduction of functional groups in the organic linker or the secondary building unit (SBU) has been reported to be effective in improving separation selectivity toward CH4/C2H6/C3H8 mixtures. (15,24,25) Meanwhile, to our knowledge, the postsynthetic modification is also acknowledged to exhibit excellent capability to introduce specific functional groups and preserve the original skeleton structure well. (25,26) Therefore, it is worth exploring the preparation of new MOFs by postsynthetic modification for natural gas purification.
  </p>
  <p>
   Recently, the CFA-1 (Coordination Framework Augsburg-1) structure (Figure 1a), constructed by the Kuratowski-type SBU {Zn5(OAc)4}6+ (OAc- = acetate) and the achiral linker bibta2- (bibta2- = 1H,1′H-5,5′-bibenzo[d][1,2,3]triazolate), is standing out as a convenient platform for postsynthetic modifications on MOFs to realize enhanced adsorption and catalysis performance. (26-30) This Kuratowski-type SBU contains two types of Zn2+ sites, including one central Zn2+ site coordinated with four nitrogen atoms from different triazolate rings and four peripheral Zn2+ sites connected with three nitrogen atoms from three triazolate rings and two oxygen atoms from one OAc- ligand. Intriguingly, the latter Zn2+ sites are available to be replaced by other transition metal ions, while their coordinated OAc- ligands can be exchanged with monovalent anionic ligands. Hence, with the metal ions and ligands readily exchanged in the postmodification process, the electrostatic environment and pore system of the CFA-1 structure can be rationally tuned, which might play a significant role in light hydrocarbon separation, such as CH4/C2H6/C3H8 separation.
  </p>
  <p>
   Herein, we employed a simultaneous metal/ligand exchange strategy to prepare postmodified MOFs for enhanced C2-C3 selective recovery from natural gas upgrading for the first time. By utilization of CFA-1 as the scaffold, the metal ion and ligand in the {Zn5(OAc)4}6+ SBU were simultaneously exchanged with other metal ions (Co2+ and Ni2+) and ligands (Cl- and Br-) in the modulator to obtain MOFs with multivariate compositions (Figure 1b). The pristine and modified CFA-1 samples were characterized, and subsequently, their adsorptive separation performance toward C3H8, C2H6, and CH4 was examined. The effects of the species and the amount of the modulator on the structure and separation performance were discussed. Among all the modified samples, CFA-1-NiCl2-2.3 exhibited the maximum uptakes for C2H6 and C3H8 as well as the highest selectivity for C3H8/C2H6/CH4 mixture. Furthermore, the origin of the enhanced separation performance for C3H8/C2H6/CH4 mixtures on CFA-1-NiCl2-2.3 was comprehensively revealed in terms of the adsorption site, interaction strength, and adsorption density. Last, cyclic breakthrough tests and stability measurements were conducted to demonstrate the practical potential for C2-C3 selective recovery from natural gas on CFA-1-NiCl2-2.3.

   2.2. Simultaneous Metal/Ligand Exchange in CFA-1
  </h2>
  <p>
   The pristine CFA-1 was synthesized according to the methods reported by Bien. (27) 200 mg of activated CFA-1 was dispersed in a solution of 80 mL of dimethylformamide (DMF) dissolving a certain amount of the modulators and kept for 48 h in the water bath at 333 K, from which the target-modified samples were obtained. First, various modulators, including Ni(OAc)2, Co(OAc)2, NiCl2, CoCl2, and CoBr2, were employed in the modification process, with the same Co2+/Zn2+ or Ni2+/Zn2+ molar ratio of 0.3 in the ion-exchange reaction. The modified samples were recovered by filtration, washed with DMF and MeOH, and dried at 393 K under vacuum. Accordingly, the modified MOFs were named CFA-1-Ni(OAc)2-0.3, CFA-1-Co(OAc)2-0.3, CFA-1-NiCl2-0.3, CFA-1-CoCl2-0.3, and CFA-1-CoBr2-0.3, respectively. After NiCl2 was determined as the best modular, DMF solutions with higher Ni2+/Zn2+ molar ratios of 2.3 and 15 were also employed in the exchange reaction of CFA-1 to confirm the optimal modulator amount. The obtained modified samples were named CFA-1-NiCl2-2.3 and CFA-1-NiCl2-15.

   3.1. Screening the Optimal Modulator in Simultaneous Metal/Ligand Exchange for Enhanced CH4/C2H6/C3H8 Separation
  </h2>
  <p>
   The metal and ligand species of MOFs have significant impact on their structure and separation performance. Thus, we chose CFA-1 as the scaffold, and subsequently, modulators with specific metal ions (Co2+ and Ni2+) and monovalent ligands (Cl- and Br-) were simultaneously exchanged with part of Zn2+ and OAc- in the Kuratowski-type SBU of CFA-1 to prepare a series of multivariate MOF samples. After a preliminary trial of simultaneous metal/ligand exchange, elemental characterizations by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) indicated that about one peripheral Zn2+ site of the pristine SBU was exchanged to Co2+ or Ni2+ with a Co2+/Zn2+ or Ni2+/Zn2+ molar ratio of 0.3 in the postmodification process, as shown in Table S1. Hence, the same Co2+/Zn2+ or Ni2+/Zn2+ molar ratio of 0.3 was utilized in the control experiment for all modulators, including Ni(OAc)2, Co(OAc)2, NiCl2, CoCl2, and CoBr2. Correspondingly, the modified samples were termed CFA-1-Ni(OAc)2-0.3, CFA-1-Co(OAc)2-0.3, CFA-1-NiCl2-0.3, CFA-1-CoCl2-0.3, and CFA-1-CoBr2-0.3.
  </p>
  <p>
   The textural properties of the pristine and modified samples were characterized to determine their physicochemical difference. Figure 2a presents the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of all samples, which exhibited almost identical intensity in the prominent diffraction peaks at 5.6 and 7.3°, implying that the simultaneous metal-ligand exchange process caused no phase change or damage to the crystal skeleton of CFA-1. Thermogravimetric (TG) results of the samples shown in Figure 2b indicated that two distinct steps of weight loss were observed with an increase in temperature. The first weight loss from 313 to 413 K was attributed to the removal of guest solvent molecules sealed inside the samples; the second sharp weight loss step occurred at around 703 K, indicative of high temperature required for the crystallite collapse and excellent thermal stability of the samples. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images suggested that all of the postmodified samples were similar to the pristine CFA-1 in size and morphology, showing a consistent polyhedral crystal shape with dimensions of 3.5-10 μm (Figure S2). Moreover, the mapping data from energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis showed that the target-exchanged metal/ligand species were distributed evenly inside the crystals, which is a valid proof of the successful simultaneous metal/ligand exchange (Figure S3). Based on N2 sorption isotherms at 77 K (Figure 2c), the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area, pore volume, and pore size distribution were derived, as shown in Figure 2d and Table S2. Typical type-I profiles of N2 isotherms were observed with high N2 adsorption capacity on all of the samples, giving large BET surface areas of 1903.3-2056.1 m2/g and micropore volumes of 0.6-0.7 cm3/g. It is noticed that these postmodified samples exhibited a slightly higher BET surface area than the pristine CFA-1, which might be attributed to the replacement of the bulkier Zn2+ or OAc- by the smaller Ni2+/Co2+ or Cl-/Br-. In addition, as calculated by the nonlocal density functional theory model (Figure 2d), the pore size distribution was concentrated in the micropore range of 10-12 Å, while a small amount of the pores falling between 12.5 and 14.8 Å might be originated from the crystal defects in the samples. This porosity characterization also implied that the metal/ligand in the modulator was encapsulated within the framework instead of loading on the surface because the latter would lead to a significantly reduced porosity.
  </p>
  <p>
   For the evaluation of the equilibrium adsorption behavior of CH4/C2H6/C3H8 on the samples, the single-component gas isotherms were measured at 298 K, as shown in Figure 3a-c. For CFA-1, the uptakes for C3H8, C2H6, and CH4 were 6.52, 3.90, and 0.72 mmol/g, respectively, consistent with the sequence of the polarizabilities of the gas molecules. (31) Inspiringly, all of the modified samples possessed higher capacities of C3H8 and C2H6 than the pristine CFA-1, while the CH4 uptakes of all samples were nearly unchanged. As a consequence, the simultaneous metal/ligand exchange strategy resulted in improved separation performance for C2H6/CH4 and C3H8/CH4 mixtures. In particular, CFA-1-NiCl2-0.3 with NiCl2 as the modulator achieved the maximum uptakes of C3H8 and C2H6, up to 7.87 and 4.49 mmol/g, respectively, increased by 21 and 15% compared to CFA-1. Figure 3d presents a comparison of the uptake ratios for C3H8/CH4 and C2H6/CH4 on all samples. As expected, all of the modified samples demonstrated superior uptake ratios of C3H8/CH4 and C2H6/CH4 compared to CFA-1, among which CFA-1-NiCl2-0.3 exhibited the highest uptake ratio, indicative of its highest selectivity. It could be inferred that the replacement of the peripheral Zn2+ sites and the coordinated OAc- ligand by Ni2+ and Cl- in pristine CFA-1 played a crucial role in the enhanced selective adsorption of C2H6 and C3H8 from CH4. Based on the above result, NiCl2 was selected as the optimal modulator for CFA-1 modification.

  <h2>
   3.2. Adjusting the Modulator Amount for Optimal CH4/C2H6/C3H8 Separation Performance
  </h2>
  <p>
   After NiCl2 was determined as the best modulator, the exchanged amounts of Ni2+ and Cl- were rationally adjusted by employing various Ni2+/Zn2+ molar ratios of 0.3, 2.3, and 15 in the exchange reaction. Figure S4 presents the PXRD patterns of CFA-1-NiCl2-0.3 and CFA-1-NiCl2-2.3, which exhibited peak positions and intensities similar to those of pristine CFA-1, indicative of their well-preserved crystal structures. However, an apparent reduction in the peak intensity was observed for CFA-1-NiCl2-15, probably because the solution with a high concentration of NiCl2 might damage part of the structure of the sample. From the EDX-mapping images in Figure S6, it could be seen that Ni2+ and Cl- were homogeneously distributed within the crystals, and notably, they were more densely scattered as the concentration of NiCl2 was increased in the exchange reaction, suggesting that a greater proportion of the Zn2+ ions and OAc- ligand was replaced by Ni2+ and Cl- in the CFA-1 structure. The incorporated amount of metal ions and anionic monovalent ligands in the samples was precisely confirmed by the ICP-OES analysis and ion chromatography (IC) analysis. Consistent with the EDX result, both Ni2+ and Cl- contents in the modified MOFs gradually rose with the concentration of NiCl2 in the metal/ligand exchange reaction (Figure 4a and Tables S3 and S4). For CFA-1-NiCl2-0.3, CFA-1-NiCl2-2.3, and CFA-1-NiCl2-15, the corresponding molar ratios of Ni2+/Zn2+ were 0.16, 1.0, and 1.6, verifying that considerable amounts of Zn2+ were exchanged. Meanwhile, the corresponding molar ratios of Cl-/OAc- were 1.0, 3.5, and 7.2, respectively, and hence, a majority of OAc- was replaced by Cl- when the concentration of Cl- reached a certain level. In addition, it is apparent that OAc- was more easily exchanged than Zn2+, probably because the OAc- ligand is in the outer environment of the MOF structure, while the peripheral Zn2+ site exists in an inner space, making Zn2+ more challenging to be accessed and exchanged than OAc- due to steric hindrance.
  </p>
  <p>
   Figure 4b and Table S5 show the N2 isotherms at 77 K, the BET surface area, and the micropore volume of the NiCl2-modified samples. It can be seen that CFA-1-NiCl2-0.3 and CFA-1-NiCl2-2.3 exhibited improved porosity compared to CFA-1, of which CFA-1-NiCl2-2.3 possessed the highest micropore volume and largest BET surface area, reaching up to 0.684 cm3/g and 2090.7 m2/g. However, a smaller BET surface area and micropore volume were observed on CFA-1-NiCl2-15 than the original CFA-1, which may be attributed to the partial collapse of the framework.
  </p>
  <p>
   Figure 5a presents the single-component adsorption isotherms of C3H8, C2H6, and CH4 for all of the NiCl2-modified CFA-1 samples. The capacities of C3H8 and C2H6 at 298 K and 1 bar followed the order CFA-1-NiCl2-2.3 > CFA-1-NiCl2-0.3 > CFA-1 > CFA-1-NiCl2-15, while the CH4 uptakes were close to 0.7 mmol/g for all samples except for CFA-1-NiCl2-15 with a smaller value of 0.56 mmol/g. The C2H6 and C3H8 capacities of CFA-1-NiCl2-2.3 were 5.00 and 8.59 mmol/g, 29 and 32% higher than those of CFA-1, respectively. Consequently, CFA-1-NiCl2-2.3 possessed the highest uptake ratios at 1 bar toward C3H8/CH4 (11.9) and C2H6/CH4 (6.9), which were significantly improved as compared to CFA-1 with values of 9.4 and 5.6 (Figure 5b). For CFA-1-NiCl2-15, although its smaller micropore volume led to slightly lower adsorption capacity for C3H8 and C2H6, the uptake ratios of C3H8/CH4 and C2H6/CH4 were still higher than that of CFA-1 because of its significantly reduced CH4 uptake. Therefore, the modulator amount is also vitally important in optimizing the selective adsorption performance of the NiCl2-exchanged samples.
  </p>
  <p>
   Figure 5c,d and Table S6 present a comparison of CFA-1-NiCl2-2.3 and some typical MOFs in the aspect of the uptakes of C2H6 and C3H8 as well as the uptake ratios of C2H6/CH4 and C3H8/CH4 in order to evaluate their performance for light alkane separation. (1,15,17,32-39) Specifically, CFA-1-NiCl2-2.3 exhibited superhigh uptakes toward C2H6 and C3H8, surpassing a majority of the other reported MOFs, such as UTSA-32, MFM-202a, PCN-224, CoMOF-74, MIL-160, etc. Moreover, its uptake ratios of C2H6/CH4 and C3H8/CH4 were comparatively high among the reported MOFs. Hence, with a good combination of excellent capacity and selectivity, CFA-1-NiCl2-2.3 demonstrated great promise as an ideal adsorbent for light alkane separation and recovery of C2H6 and C3H8 from natural gas.
  </p>
  <p>
   Adsorptive selectivity is a key parameter in determining the separation performance of the gas mixtures on an adsorbent. (40,41) In addition to the uptake ratios, the adsorptive selectivities of binary mixtures on CFA-1-NiCl2-2.3 and CFA-1 were evaluated based on the ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST), which is a common and practical approach to take into account the competitive adsorption of the gas mixtures. (42) Before the selectivity calculation, the adsorption isotherms of CH4, C2H6, and C3H8 on samples were well fitted according to the dual-site Langmuir-Freundlich model with correlation coefficients reaching as high as 0.999, whose results are tabulated in Table S7. Figure S10 presents the IAST selectivities of CFA-1-NiCl2-2.3 and CFA-1 for C2H6/CH4 (10/85, v/v) and C3H8/CH4 (5/85, v/v) at 298 K. Notably, the selectivities for C2H6/CH4 and C3H8/CH4 of CFA-1-NiCl2-2.3 reached 15.2 and 382.7 at 1 bar, respectively, 1.3 and 1.7 times that of CFA-1. The remarkably increased IAST selectivities for CFA-1-NiCl2-2.3 were consistent with the uptake ratio result, suggesting its remarkable selectivity toward C2H6 and C3H8 over CH4.
  </p>
  <p>
   Apart from capacity and selectivity, the stability in a moist environment is of great importance in industrial applications. As presented in Figure S11, after being exposed to moist air for 2 months, CFA-1-NiCl2-2.3 did not show apparent loss in crystallinity, as evidenced by the well-preserved PXRD patterns. Moreover, the C3H8 and C2H6 uptakes for CFA-1-NiCl2-2.3 only exhibited a small reduction of about 8%. As a consequence, the excellent moisture stability further illustrates the industrial feasibility of CFA-1-NiCl2-2.3 for light hydrocarbon separation.

  <h2>
   3.3. Insight into the Enhanced CH4/C2H6/C3H8 Separation Performance on CFA-1-NiCl2-2.3
  </h2>
  <p>
   For comprehensive insight into the enhanced C3H8/C2H6/CH4 selectivity of CFA-1-NiCl2-2.3 compared to CFA-1, the adsorption behavior of the guest molecules on these samples was investigated theoretically and experimentally, including the adsorption site, interaction strength, and adsorption density. With the aim of Materials Studio 7.0, (43) the adsorption site was calculated and is shown in Figure 6. It suggested that all of the adsorbed guest molecules could form multiple interactions with both structures. For the pristine CFA-1, weak C-H N hydrogen bonds were formed between the C-H bonds of the guest molecules and the N atoms in the bibta linkers, while the phenyl rings from the bibta linker and the methyl group from the OAc- ligand interacted with the guest molecules via the dispersion force. The selective adsorption for C2H6 and C3H8 over CH4 on CFA-1 originated from their greater polarizability, larger molecular size, and more significant number of C-H bonds that gave rise to both enhanced strength and an increasing number of the dispersion interactions. When CFA-1 was transformed to CFA-1-NiCl2-2.3, about half of the peripheral Zn2+ ions were replaced by Ni2+, and the majority of the OAc- ligands were exchanged by Cl-, which significantly changed the electrostatic environment and pore system. Hence, the adsorption mechanism of CH4, C2H6, and C3H8 on CFA-1-NiCl2-2.3 was somewhat different from that on CFA-1. On the one hand, most of the dispersion interactions between the guest molecules and the methyl group from the OAc- ligands were gone, partially weakening the host-guest interactions. On the other hand, there are several factors that compensated the host-guest interactions. First, CFA-1-NiCl2-2.3 was more prone to polarize the guest molecules given the higher electronegativity of Ni2+ (1.91) over Zn2+ (1.65), leading to a shortened distance between the guest molecules and the metal center. Second, due to the smaller size of Cl- than OAc-, the anion replacement led to a reduction in steric hindrance between the guest molecules and the neighboring space of the metal clusters, further reducing the distance between the guest molecules and the bibta linkers, as shown in Figure 6d,f. In addition, the electronegative Cl- interacted with C3H8 via induced polarization, while this interaction was much weaker for C2H6 and CH4. Therefore, it was possible for the difference in the adsorption site to influence the adsorption enthalpy and density of guest molecules.
  </p>
  <p>
   To quantify the adsorption enthalpy, Figure S14 presents the isosteric heat (Qst) and simulated interaction energy of all guest molecules on CFA-1 and CFA-1-NiCl2-2.3. The obtained Qst values for C3H8, C2H6, and CH4 were 32.3, 28.0, and 16.7 kJ/mol on CFA-1-NiCl2-2.3, while the values were 33.1, 29.3, and 18.3 kJ/mol on CFA-1, respectively. The trend of Qst on the three guest molecules on both samples suggested stronger interactions of C3H8 and C2H6 than CH4. Though the Qst of these guest molecules on CFA-1-NiCl2-2.3 is slightly lower than that on CFA-1, the Qst ratios for the gas mixtures on CFA-1-NiCl2-2.3 (1.93 for C3H8/CH4 and 1.68 for C2H6/CH4) became larger in comparison with those on CFA-1 (1.81 for C3H8/CH4 and 1.60 for C2H6/CH4). In addition, the interaction energy between the adsorbent and the gas molecules, as calculated by the Sorption module from Materials Studio 7, exhibited similar results with Qst. Hence, the enhancement of the Qst ratios for C3H8/CH4 and C2H6/CH4 on CFA-1-NiCl2-2.3 probably contributed to the increased selectivity toward C3H8/CH4 and C2H6/CH4.
  </p>
  <p>
   Furthermore, the difference in the adsorption density distributions of the guest molecules on CFA-1 and CFA-1-NiCl2-2.3 was investigated, as shown in Figure 7. It is apparent that the adsorption density of CFA-1-NiCl2-2.3 was significantly higher than that of pristine CFA-1 in the neighboring space of the Kuratowski-type metal nodes. As a result, the adsorption density of CFA-1-NiCl2-2.3 for all guest molecules was significantly higher than that of CFA-1. The increase in adsorption density was attributed to the following factors: first, the exchanged Ni2+ cation exhibits higher electronegativity than Zn2+; second, the neighboring space of the metal clusters, including the N atoms and the phenyl rings in the bibta linkers, is more accessible for the guest molecules owing to the decreased steric hindrance by replacement of OAc- by Cl-; third, more contact area and space for the adsorbent-adsorbate interaction is created after the postmodification of the metal nodes using the simultaneous metal/ligand exchange strategy, as indicated by the larger BET surface area (2090.7 versus 1903.3 m2/g). Generally, it is accepted that the higher the adsorption density, the higher the gas capacity. Hence, the significant increase in adsorption density is the main origin of the enhanced adsorption capacity of C2H6 and C3H8.

   Breakthrough experiments were carried out to evaluate the real-world performance of CFA-1-NiCl2-2.3 for the selective recovery of C2H6 and C3H8 from natural gas. Figure 8a exhibits the breakthrough curves of CH4/C2H6/C3H8 (85/10/5, v/v/v) ternary gas mixture through the fixed bed of CFA-1-NiCl2-2.3 at 298 K. It can be seen that CH4, with the weakest adsorption binding force, first eluted out at the very beginning of the test. Subsequently, C2H6 remained in the adsorption column for a longer residue time and was detected after about 9 min. More strikingly, C3H8 broke through at 68 min, significantly later than C2H6 and CH4, due to the strongest affinity between the C3H8 molecule and the framework. In addition, the breakthrough curves of CH4 exhibited a small roll-up before C2H6 elution because the originally adsorbed CH4 on the framework was pushed out by the flowing C2H6 and thus increased the outlet concentration of CH4. Likewise, the noticeable roll-up of C2H6 was observed just before the breakthrough of C3H8, mainly attributed to the competitive adsorption of C2H6 and C3H8. As a consequence, the breakthrough experiments demonstrated that CFA-1-NiCl2-2.3 could achieve excellent dynamic separation performance for the CH4/C2H6/C3H8 ternary gas mixture. To examine the regeneration performance, cyclic breakthrough experiments for the CH4/C2H6/C3H8 mixture were conducted on CFA-1-NiCl2-2.3, as shown in Figure 8b. CFA-1-NiCl2-2.3 featured a fully reproducible separation performance in several cycles of adsorption and desorption with almost identical breakthrough time for all gases, indicative of its excellent cyclic stability.

   4. Conclusions

  <p>
   In summary, a simultaneous metal/ligand exchange strategy was successfully employed to modify the Kuratowski-type metal nodes of CFA-1, affording MOFs with multivariate compositions. Particularly, the optimal sample CFA-1-NiCl2-2.3, with approximately half of the peripheral Zn2+ ions replaced by Ni2+ and the majority of the OAc- ligands exchanged by Cl-, exhibited excellent C2H6 and C3H8 uptakes of 5.00 and 8.59 mmol/g at 298 K and 1 bar, respectively, increased by 29 and 32% compared to that of CFA-1. More importantly, its uptake ratios for C2H6/CH4 and C3H8/CH4 reached 11.7 and 6.9, respectively, indicative of excellent C2H6/CH4 and C3H8/CH4 selectivity. The remarkable capacity and selectivity of CFA-1-NiCl2-2.3 exceeded a majority of the reported MOFs for recovering C2H6 and C3H8 from natural gas. Molecular simulation suggested that selective interaction between Ni2+/Cl- ions and C2H6/C3H8 molecules over CH4 via induced polarization, together with more contact area between the guest molecules and the adsorbent, gave rise to an enlarged adsorption enthalpy difference for C2H6/CH4 and C3H8/CH4 as well as increased adsorption density for C3H8 and C2H6, from which enhanced selectivity and capacity toward C2H6 and C3H8 can be achieved. In addition, cyclic breakthrough experiments confirmed that CFA-1-NiCl2-2.3 achieved effective and fully reproducible separation toward C3H8/C2H6/CH4. Combined with excellent separation performance, moderate adsorption enthalpy, and excellent thermal and chemical stability, CFA-1-NiCl2-2.3 possesses remarkable industrial feasibility in light alkane purification. Furthermore, this simultaneous postsynthetic metal/ligand exchange strategy is worthy of further exploitation for facile functionalization of other MOFs to achieve excellent adsorptive separation performance.
