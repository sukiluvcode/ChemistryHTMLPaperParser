   Abstract
  </h2>
  <p>
   High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideHere, we report a double-bent-ligand strategy which addresses a commonly encountered challenge in the construction of pillar-layered structures with corrugated layers which are common for nonlinearly coordinated ligands and low-symmetry chiral ligands. Specifically, we show here that out-of-alignment metal coordination sites between two adjacent and opposing layers caused by in-layer bent-type ligands could be joined by another ligand type with a matching bent angle. Two isoreticular metal-organic frameworks, CPM-63m and CPM-63a, are presented here to illustrate the implementation of this strategy. Specifically, [Zn2(RCOO)4] paddlewheel dimers are bridged by bent FDC2- (H2FDC = 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid) to form neutral kagome layers. The resulting corrugated layers are successfully pillared by bent MTZ- (HMTZ = 5-methyltetrazole) or ATZ- ligands (HATZ = 5-aminotetrazole). Furthermore, the MTZ- and ATZ- pillars offer open N-donor sites, and gas sorption studies of N2, CO2, CH4, C2H2, C2H4, and C2H6 show that these materials are highly porous. In addition, they exhibit interesting inverse ethane/ethylene separation properties and good CO2/CH4 separation.

  <h2>
   Introduction
  </h2>
  <p>
   While sophisticated ligand design has played an increasingly important role in new materials discovery processes, (1-4) the use of simple and readily available ligands continues to offer fascinating new materials types and at the same time offers deeper insight into key synthetic and structural parameters in the materials design. (5-9) Such a phenomenon is especially true for metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), which have been widely investigated for many applications, including gas storage, (10-13) gas separation, (14-16) catalysis, (17-19) drug delivery, (20-22) and so on. (23-25) This is because in comparison with other crystalline porous materials (CPM), MOFs have far richer compositional and topological diversity. (26-28) For example, various functionalized and/or elongated ligands could be used to synthesize the same topologic structural type in various types of MOFs (e.g.. the IRMOF-74 series), (29-31) which allow for the systematic design of both pore structure and functionality.
  </p>
  <p>
   The creation of new topological types and the creation of isoreticular series of the same framework type in tunable chemical compositions represent two broad pathways in MOF design. (32,33) For the synthetic design of isoreticular MOFs, which is the theme of the work reported here, the tolerance of a given topological type to the variation in the structural features of the basic building blocks is of great interest. Of general interest is whether the lost tolerance caused by one structural parameter can be restored with a change in another independent structural parameter. (34) A prominent factor in this regard is the coordination orientation of ligand functional groups and the related metal nodes, because a small difference could lead to a completely different topology or no crystallization at all. (35) In general, it is hard to replicate the network topology of linear-ligand-based MOFs with bent ligands, especially those having high bent angles. This is particularly true for a MOF system with only one type of ligand. An interesting example is that while MIL-88/MOF-525-type MOFs (acs topology) can be readily constructed with metal trimers and a linear terephthalate ligand, (36,37) the combination of a bent FDC2- ligand and trimers has been shown to give the pcu-type framework. (38) This is an example of the acs to pcu conversion caused by ligand bending. Intriguingly, the reverse topological conversion (pcu to acs caused by the ligand bending) has recently been found with [Zn4O]6+ tetramers. In this case, while MOF-5-type MOFs are constructed with [Zn4O]6+ and a linear dicarboxylic ligand and has pcu topology, (39) the acs-type framework was obtained when [Zn4O]6+ tetramers are joined with a bent dicarboxylic ligand. (40) Since each ligand in the pcu and acs nets plays an identical role as far as the net type is concerned, the suppression of the pcu-acs transformation in either direction proves challenging. In this work, we have studied a kagome type lattice involving two types of ligands, and we show here an example of restoring the tolerance of the kagome lattice to bent layer-forming ligands with matching bent layer-pillaring ligands.
  </p>
  <p>
   Parallel to the aforementioned two well-known topological types for trimer- and tetramer-based materials (cubic pcu or hexagonal acs nets) whose formation is much affected by the ligand bent angles, there are also two well-known structural patterns formed from paddlewheel dimers. In fact, a recurring structural mode for paddlewheel dimers such as [Zn2(RCOO)4] is the formation of 2-D layers with one ligand type and the pillaring of layers with another type of ligand. In general, the 2-D layer is of the square net type with all four-membered rings when either bent or linear ligands are used. (41,42) In comparison, the 2-D kagome lattice based on the two different ring sizes of 3 and 6 (denoted kgm) has been much more infrequently observed. (43) It has been reported that a three-dimensional kagome lattice (denoted kag) could be constructed with kagome layers made from a paddlewheel building unit bridged with a linear dicarboxylic ligand and further pillared by a linear N-donor ligand. (44) However, no kag lattice based on bent ligands has been reported even though kgm layers have been found to occur with a paddlewheel unit and a bent dicarboxylate, including FDC2- and m-BDC2- (H2m-BDC= isophthalic acid). (45)
  </p>
  <p>
   A key issue related to the formation of a paddlewheel-based pillar-layered lattice is the alignment of dimer axial sites pointing toward the interlayer region. For a linear dicarboxylate, they are aligned 180°, which matches well with common linear N-donor ligands. When a bent dicarboxylate is used, the alignment of dimer axial sites deviates greatly from 180° and usually varies according to the ligand type (e.g.. H2FDC, H2m-BDC, thiophenedicarboxylic acid, d-camphoric acid, and l-isocamphoric acid). (46) Because of such variations in the ligand-dependent alignment of axial coordination sites, finding a matching bent pillaring ligand is far less straightforward that the construction of materials based on linear ligands.
  </p>
  <p>
   To target the synthesis of a three-dimensional kagome lattice with bent dicarboxylates, herein, we propose a "double-bent" strategy with CPM-63m and CPM-63a as illustrative examples. This strategy involves the use of another bent N-donor ligand (Scheme 1). In comparison with the linear pillar, the binding angle toward two adjacent layers offered by the bent ligands chosen in this work matches well with nonlinearly oriented axial binding sites of paddlewheels in adjacent layers, which leads to successful pillaring of the corrugated layers. Interestingly, the tetrazolate pillars offer two or more open N-donor sites and the resulting material shows good CO2/CH4 separation properties and inverse ethane/ethylene separation.

   Single-Crystal X-ray Diffraction Characterization
  </h2>
  <p>
   Single-crystal X-ray diffraction was performed on a Bruker Smart APEX II CCD area diffractometer at room temperature using graphite-monochromated Mo Kα (λ= 0.71073 Å) radiation, operating in the ω and φ scan mode. Diffraction data were integrated and scaled by the "multiscan" method with the Bruker APEX software. The structure was solved with the SHELXTL package and Olex2 program using an intrinsic phasing method and refined with least-squares analysis. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. The residual electron peaks inside the lattice pores from the solvents and cations could not be modeled and were removed using the Squeeze function from the PLATON software. Crystal data and structure refinement details are given in Table 1.

   Powder X-ray Diffraction (PXRD) Characterization
  </h2>
  <p>
   Powder X-ray diffraction experiments were performed on a PANalytical X'Pert Pro MPD diffractometer, equipped with a linear X'Celerator detector operating at 40 kV and 35 mA (Cu Kα radiation, λ = 1.5418 Å). The data collection was performed at room temperature in the range from 5 to 40° with a step size of ~0.008°.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Thermogravimetric (TG) Measurement
  </h2>
  <p>
   A TA Instruments TGA Q500 thermal analyzer was used to measure the TG curve by heating the sample from 30 to 800 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C/min under a nitrogen flow. The flow rate of the nitrogen gas was controlled at about 60 mL/min.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Gas Sorption Measurement
  </h2>
  <p>
   Gas sorption measurements were carried out on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 PLUS Physisorption Analyzer. The as-synthesized sample was first cooled to room temperature and then washed with DMF. The sample was then activated by solvent exchange in dichloromethane for 3 days, with the solution being refreshed every 24 h. The dichloromethane was decanted, and then the sample was dried under an air flow. Before gas adsorption, the sample was degassed using the degas function of the analyzer at 60 °C for 12 h. N2 adsorption was measured at 77 K. CO2, CH4, C2H2, C2H4, and C2H6 adsorption isotherms were measured at both 273 and 296 K.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Isosteric Heat of Adsorption (Qst)
  </h2>
  <p>
   The isosteric heats of adsorption for CO2, CH4, C2H2, C2H4, and C2H6 were calculated using the isotherms at 273 and 298 K, following the Clausius-Clapeyron equation with the program embedded in the software of ASAP 2020 plus. High accuracy of the Qst value was found in all the calculations, as evidenced by the linearity in the isosteres.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Selectivity by IAST
  </h2>
  <p>
   To evaluate CO2/CH4 and C2H6/C2H4 separation performance, the selectivities were calculated by ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST). A single-site or dual-site Langmuir-Freundlich (SLF or DLF) model was employed to fit the gas adsorption isotherms over the entire pressure range. The SLF model can be written as(1)and the DLF model can be written as(2)where N is the quantity adsorbed, p is the pressure of bulk gas at equilibrium with the adsorbed phase, Nsat is the saturation loading for adsorption sites, and b is the affinity parameter. 1/n is the index of heterogeneity. The R factors for all the fitting are higher than 99.9%.
  </p>
  <p>
   The detailed methodology for calculating the amount of A and B adsorption from a mixture by IAST is described elsewhere. (47) The adsorption selectivity is finally defined as(3)where qi (i = A, B) is the uptake quantity in the mixture and pi is the feeding partial pressure of component i.

   A key structural feature is the formation of a 2-D kagome lattice where Zn2 paddlewheels are connected by 2-connected bent FDC2- cross-linkers. CPM-63m crystallizes in a hexagonal system with the space group P63/mmc. It has a formula of [Zn2(MTZ)(FDC)2]-[(CH3)2NH2]+. The building block of CPM-63m is the Zn2 paddlewheel, which is formed when two Zn atoms are held together by the coordination of four carboxylate groups from four FDC2- ligands (Scheme S1). Each paddlewheel connects with four adjacent paddlewheels with an FDC2- ligand as the bridge, forming a two-dimensional kagome net with trigonal and hexagonal pores (Figure 1a). The length between adjacent dimers (from dimer center to center) is measured to be 9.58 Å (Figure S2). CPM-63a is isostructural with CPM-63m except that MTZ- is replaced by ATZ-.
  </p>
  <p>
   Unlike commonly observed pillar-layered structures, the orientation of the open metal sites from the paddlewheel is not perpendicular to the Zn2-FDC layer due to the bent configuration of FDC2-. It should also be noted that, unlike the flexible square layer, the 3-ring-containing kagome layer is quite rigid, which limits the range of the geometric conformation of the [Zn2(RCOO)4] paddlewheels and the orientation of axial open metal sites. As such, it is unlikely that the corrugated layers could be accommodative enough to be pillared by the linear N-donor ligand.
  </p>
  <p>
   We reported earlier that corrugated layers made from Zn2(RCOO)4 paddlewheels and chiral d-camphorate could be pillared through the use of an X-type TPB ligand (TPB = 1,2,4,5-tetrakis(4-pyridyl)benzene). (46) However, the use of TPB requires both binding-angle matching (bite angle of two pyridyl groups at the left or right side of X) and the binding-site-distance matching (distance between N sites of two top or two bottom pyridyl groups in X). The flexibility of the square net made from Zn2(RCOO)4 paddlewheels and d-camphorate may have contributed to the success of the X-pillaring scheme in this earlier work.
  </p>
  <p>
   For a less flexible kagome lattice, in this work, we illustrate and highlight an alternative double-bent strategy which does not require binding-site-distance matching. Given the intrinsic capacity to form corrugated Zn2-FDC layers, we systematically studied a series of bent ligands (e.g.. imidazoles, triazoles, and tetrazoles) and found that tetrazole ligands could serve our purpose of pillaring the corrugated kagome layers (Figure 1b). Since the binding angles for these azolate ligands are all similar, the success with tetrazolates as pillars is likely because the acidity of tetrazoles (pKa = 4.9 for tetrazole) is much closer to that of the H2FDC ligand (pKa = 2.28), in comparison to those of imidazoles and triazoles (pKa = 14.5 and 9.97 for imidazole and 1,2,4-triazole, respectively). In the structure, the bent angle of FDC2- was found to be 136.6° (a deviation of 43.4° from a linear configuration) (Figure S2). By treatment of the Zn2 paddlewheel as a node, the topology can be simplified as kag (i.e.. three-dimensional Kagome structure) (Figures 1c and 2). It should be noted that this is likely the first case that the three-dimensional linear BDC-based structural type has been replicated by a highly bent FDC ligand.

   Another novel structural feature of CPM-63m and CPM-63a is that the ligand charge combination is -2/-1 rather than the -2/0 commonly found for pillared MOF structures. (41) In the previous structures, the neutral kagome layer is pillared by neutral pyridine ligands, resulting in a neutral framework. In contrast, in CPM-63m and CPM-63a, the neutral layer is pillared by a negative tetrazolate ligand, rendering the whole framework negative. The charge of the negative framework is believed to be balanced by the dimethylammonium cation, (CH3)2NH2+, coming from the decomposition of DMF.

   Stability, Porosity, and Gas Uptake and Separation Properties

   The purity of the sample was verified by comparing the samples' powder X-ray patterns with simulated ones generated from the single-crystal data (Figure S3). TGA analysis indicated a high thermal decomposition temperature of 350 °C (Figure S4). The guest-accessible volume of CPM-63m is determined to be 61.4% by the PLATON program. The actual accessible volume is lower due to the existence of the charge-balanced species within the pores.
  </p>
  <p>
   Gas sorption properties for six different gases (N2, CO2, CH4, C2H2, C2H4, and C2H6) were studied here. The experiments show that both CPM-63m and CPM-63a are highly porous, which is impressive considering that they are made from very small ligands and that there is a significant pore-blockage effect exerted by charge-balancing cations. Nitrogen adsorption was measured at 77 K to determine the surface areas of CPM-63m and CPM-63a (Figure 3). It was found that CPM-63m and CPM-63a had Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface areas of 1023 and 1127 cm2/g, Langmuir surface areas of 1191.0 and 1296 cm2/g, and micropore volumes of 0.388 and 0.449 cm3/g, respectively.
  </p>
  <p>
   Since MTZ- and ATZ- only use two nitrogen atoms to connect with inorganic nodes, open N-donor sites are available as potential gas binding sites, which could be beneficial for gas separation purposes. Multiple gases have been studied to examine the gas storage and separation performance of CPM-63m and CPM-63a. CPM-63m and CPM-63a were found to have comparable gas adsorption properties for all of the test gases (Table 2 and Figures S5-S8). This is probably because that the gas adsorption sites in both structures are dominated by the two open basic N sites on the tetrazolate ring, making the influence from the substituent group negligible. As a result, CPM-63m was selected to discuss the gas adsorption properties.

   To probe the potential applications in CO2/CH4 separation, isotherms of CO2 and CH4 were measured at both 273 and 298 K. CPM-63m has saturated uptakes of 78.4 c and 43.9 cm3/g of carbon dioxide at 273 and 298 K, respectively. In contrast, it could only adsorb 20.0 and 13.3 cm3/g of methane at 273 and 298 K, respectively. On the basis of the temperature-dependent isotherms, the heat of adsorption at zero coverage was determined to be -26.6 kJ/mol for carbon dioxide and -18.9 kJ/mol for methane, indicating a good CO2/CH4 separation property. A relatively high IAST selectivity of 5.1 was also obtained (Figure 4), which is higher than those of ZIF-68-70 (3.2-3.8), (48) NH2-MIL-125 (3.9), and activated carbon (2.3). (49)

   It has been reported that materials without open-metal sites can have unique applications in the storage and separation of hydrocarbon gas molecules, including C2H6-selective C2H6/C2H4 separation. (50) As an alternative to the recently reported 9-connected pacs platform, the 6-connected 3-D kagome lattice described here represents another prototype of framework topology without open-metal sites but is capable of open Lewis base sites as shown here. The gas sorption measurements of acetylene, ethylene, and ethane were conducted. At 296 K, the gas sorption quantities reaches 76.4, 56.6, and 63.7 cm3/g for acetylene, ethylene, and ethane, respectively (Figure S5). At 273 K, the quantities increase to 126.0, 89.6, and 98.7 cm3/g, respectively. Heat of adsorptions at near-zero coverage were determined to be 30.5, 29.8, and 31.8 kJ/mol for acetylene, ethylene, and ethane, respectively. Interestingly, the inversed ethane/ethylene separation was observed in CPM-63m. The C2H6/C2H4 selectivity is calculated to be 1.41 at 1 bar, which is comparable to those some benchmark materials including TJT-100 (1.2), (51) CPM-233 (1.64), (50) and MIL-142A (1.51). (52)

   4. Conclusion
  </h2>
  <p>
   In summary, two three-dimensional Kagome metal-organic frameworks were synthesized in this work through a double-bent route. While the synthesis of isostructures is common in metal-organic frameworks, the use of bent ligands to replicate the structures predominantly on the basis of linear ligands, as shown here, is far less common. The combined use of two bent ligands provides a generalized approach to create new structures with targeted topology. The 2-connected coordination mode of tetrazolates in these two structures is interesting and leaves open Lewis basic N sites, and the resulting materials show good CO2/CH4 separation properties and interesting inverse C2H6/C2H4 separation.
