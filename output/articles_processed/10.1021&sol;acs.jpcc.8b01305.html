   Abstract

  <p>
   High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideWe use molecular simulations to study the adsorption of ethane and ethylene in zeolitic imidazolate frameworks. The separation of these two compounds is a crucial step in many industrial processes, most of them related to production of ethylene. Separation methods such as fractional cryogenic distillation require large energy consumption that increases the costs of ethylene production. Here, we analyze the suitability of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks for the separation of these gases on the basis of structural and chemical features. We pay special attention to the effect exerted by other gases on the adsorption and diffusion of ethane and ethylene in the structures. We found that nitrogen has an important role in the separation process and depending on the structure, it can enhance or hinder the adsorption selectivity for ethane. The presence of gases other than nitrogen also causes an effect on the ethane/ethylene separation. A mixture containing hydrogen, oxygen, methane, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, ethane, and ethylene in zeolitic imidazolate frameworks is also investigated. Our results identify ZIFs with rho, crg, and lta topologies as good candidates for the separation of ethane and ethylene.

   Introduction
  </h2>
  <p>
   The worldwide production of ethylene exceeds 140 million tons per year. (1) This olefin is one of the most used in industry, as it plays a role in the production of polyethylene, ethylene oxide, and ethylbenzene. (2) Ethylene is also a biologically active molecule that acts as a plant hormone involved in the ageing process. (3) It is used in the food industry to force the ripening of fruits. (4) Ethane, with a production of more than 5 million tons per year, (1) is usually found in mixtures with ethylene. The main process used to separate ethane from ethylene in industry is the fractional cryogenic distillation. (5) This process requires high levels of energy consumption, the cryogenic distillation columns being responsible for more than 25% of the total energy spent during gas separation. Therefore, finding alternative methods to achieve the separation is essential. One plausible option is the use of porous materials, such as zeolites or metal-organic frameworks, as molecular sieves. (6,7) Extensive work is focused on the adsorption of ethane and ethylene, as well as in binary mixture separation in zeolites and MOFs. (8-19) A notable example is the experimental study carried out by Aguado et al. on silver type-A zeolite, where they achieve high selectivity of ethylene over ethane in ternary mixtures with nitrogen. (20)
  </p>
  <p>
   The aim of this work is to study the performance of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) on the separation of ethane from ethylene. ZIFs are part of a still emerging group of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). These structures are closely related to zeolites as many of them have zeolite topology. ZIFs are formed by metallic centers of Zn or Co that are tetrahedrally coordinated by imidazolate ligands. The large variety of metal-imidazolate combinations are responsible for the vast number of structures that can be synthesized. Among other applications, ZIFs can be used in adsorption processes, (21) gas storage, (22) heterogeneous catalysis, (23,24) and as molecular sensors. (25)
  </p>
  <p>
   We study the adsorption and separation capacity of ZIF-1, -2, -3, -4, -6, -10, -20, -22, -62, -68, -71, -80, -93, -96, and -97. These structures contain Zn as the metallic center linked by ligands, such as Iimidazole (Im), nitroimidazole (nIm), methylimidazole (mIm), 1,5-dicyclohexyl imidazole (dcIm), benzimidazole (bIm), hydroxymethylmethyl imidazole (hymeIm), 4-aldemethylimidazole (almeIm), cyanide amine imidazole (cyamIm), or purinate (pur). These linkers lead to large variety of topologies and pore sizes. For instance, ZIF-1, -2, -3, -4, -6, and -10 have imidazole (Im) as ligand but their connections and orientations generate differences in the topologies (crb, crb, dft, cag, gis, and mer, respectively) and pore sizes (Figure S1 from the Supporting Information). It should be noted that ZIF-4 exhibits thermal crystal-amorphous transition above 573 K. (26) Other structures may share the same topology and differ in linkers. This is the case with ZIF-71, -93, -96, and -97 structures with rho topology but with other functionalized imidazoles (dcIm, almeIm, cyamIm, and hymeIm, respectively). The pore size distribution (PSD) reveals that the four structures have main cavities between 16 and 17 Å in diameter (Figure S2 from the Supporting Information). ZIF-20 and -22 are structures with lta topology and large linkers (pur and bIm, respectively). These structures show similar PSD with big cavities of 14 and 15 Å diameter and small cavities of about 7 Å limited by the ligand size (Figure S3 from the Supporting Information). Structures formed by two types of linkers such as ZIF-62 (Im, bIm), ZIF-68 (nIm, bIm), and ZIF-80 (nIm, dcIm) are also studied. This situation favors the creation of a variety of cavities, as evidenced by the PSDs (Figure S4 from the Supporting Information).
  </p>
  <p>
   We analyze the performance of the materials on the separation of ethane and ethylene from (a) binary mixtures (50:50 and 60:40), (b) ternary mixture with nitrogen (10:10:80), and (c) seven-component mixture with composition similar to that resulting from flue gas in industrial processes: ethane (2.9%)/ethylene (4.2%)/methane (76.9%)/hydrogen (2.1%)/oxygen (3.7%)/carbon monoxide (0.5%)/carbon dioxide (9.7%).
  </p>
  <h2>
   Models and Methods
  </h2>
  <p>
   In this work, we use molecular models for ethane and ethylene that were validated in previous works. (19,27,28) These models reproduce experimental properties of the gases, such as liquid density as a function of temperature and vapor-liquid equilibria. Previous experimental adsorption data of ethane and ethylene in ZIF-8 are in agreement with the values obtained using these models (Figure S5 from the Supporting Information). (18,29) Studies on adsorption and diffusion of the two hydrocarbons in this structure (30,31) report the swing effect in the imidazolate linkers of the structure, opening a small window that connects the main cavities of the framework. From the molecular simulation point of view, this structural flexibility could have a major effect on dynamic properties. However, this effect is negligible in adsorption studies at room temperature, as evidenced by the agreement between experiments and simulations (Figure S5 from the Supporting Information). Reported models that are well validated for adsorption in zeolites and MOFs were used for nitrogen, (32) hydrogen, (33) oxygen, (34) methane, (35) carbon monoxide, (36) and carbon dioxide. (37) Ethane, ethylene, and methane are modeled using a united atom approach, with CH3 (ethane), CH2 (ethylene), and CH4 (methane) defined as single interaction centers. Nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide are described with full atom models. Nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon monoxide models include a dummy atom equidistant to the other two atoms. This dummy atom is needed to reproduce the multipole moment of the molecule. The model used for hydrogen also takes into account Feynman-Hibbs quantum corrections. (33)Table S1 from the Supporting Information lists the parameters and point charges of all of the molecules.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lennard-Jones parameters and point charges of the structure are taken from transferable force fields and compiled in Tables S2 and S3 from the Supporting Information. (38) We use rigid models for ZIFs, and the crystallographic positions are taken from the literature. (20,39) The calculated pore volume, surface area, helium void fraction, and topology of the structures are collected in Table S4 from the Supporting Information.
  </p>
  <p>
   We calculate Coulombic interactions with the Ewald summation method with a relative precision of 10-6. Host-guest and guest-guest Lennard-Jones interactions are estimated using Lorentz-Berthelot mixing rules. The Lennard-Jones potential is cut and shifted at a cutoff distance of 12 Å.
  </p>
  <p>
   To calculate adsorption isotherms, we performed Monte Carlo (MC) simulations in the grand canonical ensemble. In our simulations, we relate the pressure to the fugacity using the Peng-Robinson equation of state. Adsorption selectivity is inferred from the isotherms. Absolute adsorption is directly related to excess adsorption using the equation (40)where P, V, and T are the pressure, volume, and temperature of the system, R is the gas constant, and z is the gas compressibility.
  </p>
  <p>
   Henry coefficients (KH) and adsorption energies and entropy are obtained from MC simulations in the canonical ensemble and carried out at zero coverage using the Widom test-particle method. (41) Pore volumes, surface areas, pore size distributions, and helium void fractions of the structures are calculated using helium probes using the aforementioned Widom particle insertion method.
  </p>
  <p>
   Molecular dynamic simulations in the canonical ensemble (NVT) are used to estimate the self-diffusion coefficient of the adsorbates in the structures, integrating Newton's laws of motion using the velocity Vertlet algorithm. The temperature is fixed with the Nosé-Hoover thermostat. (42,43)
  </p>
  <p>
   All simulations were carried out using the RASPA simulation code. (44)

  <h2>
   Results and Discussion
  </h2>
  <p>
   Deep knowledge on the distribution of the cavities of the ZIFs and their size is crucial to understand the adsorption and diffusion of guest molecules in these structures. Therefore, for accurate analysis of our simulation data, we will refer to PSDs. Figure 1 shows the Henry coefficients of the adsorbates in the 15 structures at 298 K. The values of the Henry coefficient obtained for nitrogen are, in all of the structures, at least 1 order of magnitude lower than the values obtained for ethane and ethylene. This indicates that the molecules of nitrogen do not interact strongly with the structures. Ethane shows the highest values of the Henry coefficient for all of the adsorbents, i.e.. the interaction with the atoms of the structures is stronger for ethane than for ethylene. The adsorption energies are compiled in Table S5 from the Supporting Information.
  </p>
  <p>
   Adsorption isotherms are calculated at pressures ranging from 102 to 106 Pa for pure components, binary mixtures of ethane and ethylene (50:50 and 60:40), and a ternary mixture of ethane, ethylene, and nitrogen (10:10:80) at 298 K. Absolute adsorption data is converted to excess adsorption following the equation noted in the Models and Methods section. The results obtained are depicted in Figures 2-4 and S6-S10 from the Supporting Information. Following the same trend found for the adsorption energy, pure component adsorption isotherms (Figures 2 and S6 and S7 from the Supporting Information) show that the adsorption of nitrogen is notably lower than the adsorption of ethane and ethylene for all of the structures. Ethane is adsorbed over ethylene in most of the pressure range. For the structures that reach saturation at the conditions used in this study (ZIF-1, -2, -4, -20, -22, and -62), the loading of ethane and ethylene at 106 Pa is similar. Overall, similar trends have been found comparing the results for ethane, ethylene, and nitrogen.
  </p>
  <p>
   Focusing on the results for ethane, we discuss the adsorption and separation performance of each structure. Structures with Im as the sole linker are depicted in Figure 2 (top). ZIF-1 and ZIF-4 reach a plateau at 105 Pa, and the adsorption loading in both structures is one-third of that for ZIF-2, -3, -6, or -10. This is due to the limited void space available inside these two structures (Table S4 from the Supporting Information). Figure 2 (middle) shows the results from structures with lta or rho topology, which are also the structures with the largest pore diameters. ZIF-20 and -22 (lta, pores of ~15 Å) exhibit the highest values of loading, especially at 103 and 105 Pa. At these values of pressure, their pores can be filled by guest molecules more easily than those of ZIF-71, -93, -96, and -97 (rho, pores of 16 to 17 Å). Three structures, ZIF-62, -68, and -80, are depicted in Figure 2 (bottom). From this set, ZIF-62 is saturated at 104 Pa, whereas ZIF-68 and -80 (gme topology) do not reach saturation at 106 Pa, the highest value of pressure under study. An overall preference toward the adsorption of ethane is also supported by the results from the binary and ternary mixtures.
  </p>
  <p>
   The adsorption isotherms of the 50:50 and 60:40 binary mixtures (Figures 3 and S8 and S9 from the Supporting Information) show that ethane is the most adsorbed gas in the complete pressure range. As expected, the difference between the uptake of ethane and ethylene is larger for the 60:40 mixture than for the 50:50 mixture for all of the structures.
  </p>
  <p>
   On the basis of previous studies for separation of ethane and ethylene using zeolites, (20) we performed additional simulations adding nitrogen. The goal was to evaluate the effect of this gas in the adsorption selectivity. Simulations were carried out for a 10:10:80 ethane/ethylene/nitrogen mixture, and the obtained results are depicted in Figure 4 as well as in Figure S9 from the Supporting Information. As shown in Figure 4, the adsorption of ethane in the ternary mixture has noticeable differences compared with the adsorption of the pure component (Figure 2) and binary mixtures (Figure 3). In the first group of structures, with Im linker (Figure 4 (top)), the previous marked difference between the loading of ethane in structures with higher (ZIF-2, -3, -6, and -10) and lower (ZIF-1, -4) void fractions disappears. For these structures, the loading of ethane in the ternary mixture varies between 2 and 3.5 mol kg-1 at 106 Pa. On the other hand, our results for the equimolar binary mixtures (Figure 3, top) show molecular loading ranging from 2 (ZIF-4) to 6 (ZIF-6) mol kg-1. Similar variations are also found for the other structures. This is due to the lower concentration in the bulk of ethane and ethylene which effectively reduces the larger adsorption loading at 106 Pa (Figures 4 and S10 from the Supporting Information). The adsorption is now like that obtained at 104 or 105 Pa for the binary mixtures. The loading is remarkably lower for nitrogen than for the hydrocarbons, except for ZIF-10, -71, and -80, where the adsorption of nitrogen is similar to the adsorption of ethylene (Figure S10 from the Supporting Information). In these three structures, ethylene and nitrogen compete for the same adsorption sites in analogous concentration. This is evidenced in Figure 5 that compares the distribution profiles of ethylene and nitrogen in ZIF-10.
  </p>
  <p>
   We study the adsorption selectivity to compare the affinity toward ethane of each structure. To calculate the adsorption selectivity, we use adsorption loading data of the adsorbates following this expressionwhere θiand θj are the adsorption loadings of molecules i and j and Xi and Xj are the molar fractions.
  </p>
  <p>
   The adsorption selectivity results from the binary and ternary mixtures in all of the structures are shown in Figures 6 and S11 from the Supporting Information. Figure 6 shows the adsorption selectivity of ethane over ethylene in the 50:50 binary and the ternary mixtures. The values obtained for all of the structures are quite similar, and we only observe some differences at 105 Pa and lower values of pressure. For instance, in ZIF-20 and -22, the adsorption selectivity toward ethane in the equimolar binary mixture decreases when the value of pressure goes from 103 to 104 Pa. In the case of the ternary mixture, this reduction is observed at pressures above 104 Pa. The adsorption selectivity obtained for 50:50 (Figure 6) and 60:40 (Figure S11 from the Supporting Information) ethane/ethylene binary mixtures is similar for all of the structures under study.
  </p>
  <p>
   Although nitrogen can be used experimentally to mimic industrial separation conditions of ethane and ethylene, other gases, such as methane, hydrogen, oxygen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide, can also be found during the separation process. Therefore, we performed additional simulations to study the effect of these gases on the ethane/ethylene adsorption selectivity. Simulations were carried out at 298 K and 106 Pa using a seven-component mixture of ethane (2.9%), ethylene (4.2%), methane (76.9%), hydrogen (2.1%), oxygen (3.7%), carbon monoxide (0.5%), and carbon dioxide (9.7%) in the 15 ZIFs. These amounts are related to the estimated composition of the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) effluent. The OCM method is used in the industrial production of ethylene. (45)Figure S12 in the Supporting Information contains the adsorption isotherms of ethane and ethylene in the seven-component mixture at 298 K. Adsorption selectivity of ethane over ethylene from this mixture is depicted in Figure 7. All structures show preferential adsorption of ethane over ethylene. The highest adsorption selectivity is found for ZIF-4 and -62 (cag topology), followed by ZIF-20 and -22 (lta topology). Figure 8 compares the adsorption selectivity obtained from the mixtures with three and seven components. It also illustrates the location of nitrogen molecules inside the framework. In general, variations are negligible. ZIF-20 and -22 exhibit a slightly higher selectivity with the seven-component mixture. This is analogous to the higher selectivity found for the ternary mixture when compared with the binary mixture. ZIF-20 and -22 are formed by large cages, with relatively small linkers. The available surface for the adsorbates in these ZIFs is amongst the largest in this study, at about 1800 m2/g (Table S4 from the Supporting Information). For these two structures, the higher the loading of ethane and ethylene, the lower the adsorption selectivity. Therefore, there is competitive advantage for ethane at low concentrations. This is the reason why the adsorption selectivity resulting from binary mixtures drops from 3 to 2 at pressure values above 103 Pa. For ternary mixtures, this decrease appears at higher values of pressure (above 104 Pa) and the same is observed for the seven-component mixtures above 105 Pa. The lower concentration in the bulk, combined with the presence of other gases, forces the hydrocarbons to adsorb in the main cavities, where the selectivity of ethane over ethylene is favored. Figure 9 depicts the adsorption location of the ethane molecules in ZIF-20 and -22 for the equimolar binary mixture and the seven-component mixture. It can be noted how even at relatively low loadings (seven-component mixtures), the ethane molecules tend to occupy the same spots inside the structures.
  </p>
  <p>
   For a better knowledge of the dynamic behavior of the adsorbates inside the structures, we calculated the self-diffusion coefficient of the gases from the binary (50:50 and 60:40), ternary, and the seven-component mixtures at 298 K and 106 Pa (Tables S6-S8 from the Supporting Information). The diffusion of the molecules at the simulation conditions is low in ZIF-1, -4, and -62. In these ZIFs, the cavities are interconnected by narrow channels that act as a bottleneck for the molecular diffusivity, as depicted in Figure 10. The diffusion coefficient obtained for ethylene is equal or higher than that obtained for ethane in all structures and for all mixtures studied (within the error bars). This is the expected trend based on the higher adsorption of ethane. Differences in diffusion between ethane and ethylene are not larger than 1 order of magnitude in any case.
  </p>
  <p>
   We calculate the permselectivity of ethane over ethylene using the adsorption loading data and the diffusion coefficients, following this equationwhere θi and θj are the adsorption loadings of molecules i and j, Xi and Xj are the molar fractions, and Di and Dj are the diffusion coefficients.
  </p>
  <p>
   Figures 11 and 12 and S13 and S14 from the Supporting Information show the permselectivity of ethane over ethylene for all mixtures and structures. ZIF-1, -4, and -62 were excluded because the adsorbates are unable to diffuse within their pores. These structures contain similarly sized windows connecting the main cavities, of 3.5 Å diameter. Given the size of the molecules and the rigidity of our frameworks, they are unable to diffuse through these windows. Permselectivity is similar for the 50:50 and the 60:40 binary mixtures. (Figures S13 and S14 from the Supporting Information). However, ZIF-2 (crb), -20 (lta), -22 (lta), -68 (gme), and -80 (gme) exhibit higher permselectivity for the ternary mixture (Figure 11). In contrast, for ZIF-10 (mer), -93 (rho), -96 (rho), and -97 (rho), permselectivity is lower for the ternary mixture. This decrease of permselectivity is especially noticeable on ZIF-10, which suggests a negative effect of the mer topology on the diffusion of ethane. In the case of ZIF-93, -96, and -97, the combination of large pores and rho topology impedes the diffusion of ethane.
  </p>
  <p>
   Permselectivity toward ethane is lower for the seven-component mixture in all of the structures, except for ZIF-71, -93, -96, and -97, with rho topology (Figure 12). As already discussed, these four structures show either no difference (ZIF-71) or lower (ZIF-93, -96, -97) permselectivity for the ternary mixtures compared with the binary mixture. Permselectivities taken from the seven-component and the ternary mixtures are compared in Figure 13.
  </p>
  <p>
   The self-diffusion coefficients are listed in Tables S6-S8 from the Supporting Information and can be used to interpret gas separation in ZIF-71, -93, -96, -97. For the binary 50:50 mixture, the diffusion coefficients for ethylene are higher than those for ethane, with differences ranging from 16 to 22%. For the ternary mixture, differences in diffusion go from 25 to 47%. Although adsorption selectivity taken from the isotherms of the ternary mixture is higher than that for the binary mixture, the largest differences in diffusion result in a net decrease of the permselectivity for the former scenario. In the seven-component mixture, differences in diffusion of ethane and ethylene range from 17 to 34%.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Conclusions
  </h2>
  <p>
   We show that enriched ethylene mixtures can be obtained using ZIFs with high affinity for ethane. The application of these molecular sieves in the industrial production of ethylene could reduce the amount of energy employed to achieve the separation of ethane and ethylene. Simulations support previous findings for zeolites and show that the presence of nitrogen also affects the selective behavior of ethane and ethylene in several ZIFs. Seven out of the fifteen structures analyzed here showed enhanced adsorption selectivity: ZIF-1, -20, -22, -93, -96, and -97. However, the values obtained for permselectivity reduce the list of potentially useful structures to ZIF-2, (with crg topology), ZIF-20, and -22 (with lta topology).
  </p>
  <p>
   The introduction of a seven-component mixture to the study provides further details on the understanding of the separation process of existent mixtures. We found an increase of permselectivity for ZIF-71, -93, -96, and -97 (rho topology). This suggests that a realistic approach to the separation of ethane and ethylene could be performed using these structures. Further studies including other structures with rho topology, as well as structures with crg and lta topology could follow, as derived from this study. These findings are potentially applicable for enhancing the separation step in ethylene production.
