   High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideThe fine-tuning of the pore structure of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is of critical importance to developing energy-efficient processes for the challenging separation of structurally similar molecules. Herein, we demonstrate a strategy to realize a quasi-three-dimensional refinement of the pore structure that utilizes the tunability of ring size and number in polycycloalkane-dicarboxylate ligands. Two hydrolytically stable MOFs with a confined aliphatic pore environment, ZUL-C1 and ZUL-C2, were, for the first time, synthesized and applied in separating low-concentration C2-C3 hydrocarbons from natural gas and ultralow-concentration Xe from used nuclear fuel (UNF) off-gas. Validated by X-ray diffraction and modeling, an expansion of the polycycloalkane moiety enables sub-angstrom contraction in specific directions and forms a pore surface with more alkyl sites, which affords stronger trapping of guest molecules with relatively higher polarizability. The resultant material exhibits record C2H6/CH4 and C3H8/CH4 selectivities coupled with a benchmark low-pressure C2H6 capacity in alkane mixture separation and also a benchmark Xe capacity at extremely diluted feed concentration and record Kr productivity for the Xe/Kr (20:80, v/v) mixture in Xe/Kr separation.

   Introduction
  </h2>
  <p>
   The rise of reticular chemistry, the chemistry of linking molecular building blocks by strong bonds to make crystalline open frameworks, has spawned the booming field of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and significantly expanded the scope of useful porous compounds for almost everywhere in chemistry and engineering. (1) The most important feature of MOFs is the wide varieties of pore size and chemistry through the connection of various metal nodes with organic/hybrid linkers, creating the ability to meet the task-specific requirements of different applications. (2-5) In particular, a predictable and precise refinement of pore aperture and environment is easier to be achieved for isoreticular MOFs, mainly by substituting the metal atoms, (6-10) extending the ligand molecules/ions, (11-15) or derivatizing the ligands (16-20) without the change of framework topology. The first strategy is to tailor the pore size with a sub-angstrom precision at the node of the framework, realizing a quasi-zero-dimensional fine-tuning in the coordinated network. However, suffering from the restriction of coordination number and ability, the types of available metal elements are very limited. The second and third strategies have been applied for various types of MOFs, but they are still limited to quasi-one-dimensional extension or contraction of ligands due to the structural planarity and chemical features of aromatic rings in most ligands, representing a possible limitation and reduced variation in the pore structure of the materials (Figure 1).
  </p>
  <p>
   Gas separation and purification using energy-efficient adsorption processes are a critical and challenging research area from an industrial viewpoint, where the strategic design of the MOF pore structure creates opportunities to avoid the energy-extensive separation processes such as distillation based on phase change. (21) One of the most common challenges in various MOF-based separation processes is that an increasing structural similarity of different gases requires increasing elaboration of the pore structure to improve the separation selectivity to produce high-quality chemical feedstocks or fuels. (22-24) Natural gas, as promising clean energy and important chemical feedstock, has been widely used with an increasing demand, which consists primarily of methane (CH4) and includes small amounts of ethane (C2H6) and propane (C3H8). The existence of these light hydrocarbon impurities not only reduces the conversion rate of CH4 but also affects the cyclic steady state in the storage process and safe transportation in the pipe. (25,26) Moreover, C2H6 and C3H8 are important raw materials for the manufacture of alkenes and polymers. Thus, separating C2H6 and C3H8 from CH4 is of critical importance in industry. (27-30) So far, many MOFs with different pore structures have been applied to the field of CH4/C2H6/C3H8 separation; however, their development has been greatly retarded by the C2H6/CH4 separation due to the more similar molecular size and chemical property between C2H6 and CH4 than between C3H8 and CH4. Even those MOFs with good C3H8/CH4 separation performance (MIL-142A, (31) JLU-Liu40, (32) BSF-1, (33) etc.) still face challenges in C2H6/CH4 separation, becoming a bottleneck for the simultaneous removal of multiple impurities from CH4. Except alkanes of similar carbon numbers, another important case is the separation of monoatomic noble gases xenon (Xe) and krypton (Kr), which have even closer diameters (4.10 Å for Xe and 3.69 Å for Kr) and low polarizability (40.4 × 1025 cm-3 for Xe and 24.8 × 1025 cm-3 for Kr). They are deemed as the "gold gases" for their wide application in medical imaging, lasers, and commercial lighting, (34-36) and tremendous efforts have been devoted to designing suitable MOFs for efficient Xe/Kr separation from the air-separation byproduct (37) or used nuclear fuel (UNF) off-gas (38,39) to replace the energy-intensive cryogenic distillation. But the high similarity between Xe and Kr makes it a great challenge to reach a balance between adsorption capacity and selectivity, especially in UNF reprocessing off-gas treatment with ultralow feed concentrations of Xe (400 ppm) and Kr (40 ppm). (40,41) These have created an urgent demand for more delicate control of the pore size and chemistry of MOFs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Herein, we demonstrate a strategy to realize a quasi-three-dimensional refinement of the pore structure of MOFs that utilizes the tunability of both the size and number of aliphatic rings in polycycloalkane-dicarboxylate ligands. This strategy results in a tunable confined aliphatic pore environment in isoreticular MOFs, which had good separation performance in both CH4/C2H6/C3H8 and Xe/Kr separation, combining record C2H6/CH4 and C3H8/CH4 and excellent Xe/Kr selectivities, benchmark low-pressure adsorption capacities, and superior stability. Compared with the extension/contraction of common ligands based on the planar aromatic rings, this strategy offers new potential to achieve delicate regulation of the three-dimensional size and shape of a confined pore space, by virtue of the nonplanar nature of the bridged hydrocarbon moiety. Moreover, the structural rigidity of the bridged hydrocarbon moiety is conducive to forming MOFs with permanent porosity, and its non-aromatic nature creates atypical aliphatic chemical environments in MOF pores that provide the possibility for special adsorption behavior and mechanism. (42-47) Here, we successfully synthesized two hydrolytically stable isoreticular new MOFs, ZUL-C1 (Al(OH)(O2C-C5H6-CO2)) and ZUL-C2 (Al(OH)(O2C-C8H6-CO2)), employing bicyclo[1.1.1] pentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid (H2bpdc) and cubane-1,4-dicarboxylic acid (H2cdc) as ligands, respectively (Figure 2). When the H2bpdc ligand containing a bicyclo[1.1.1] pentane backbone was replaced by the H2cdc ligand featuring a cubane (i.e.. pentacyclo [4.2.0.02,5.03,8.04,7] octane) backbone, the expansion of the aliphatic ring extended the side of the pore channel, which may weaken the host-guest interaction with a small gas molecule; however, the accompanying increase in ring number and moiety volume can effectively reduce the dimension of the accessible pore space in specific directions and form a contoured pore surface with more alkyl sites, which can favor the host-guest interaction in a confined space. By applying ZUL-C1 and ZUL-C2 in CH4/C2H6/C3H8 and Xe/Kr separation, we show that these changes can effectively improve the selectivities of similar gas molecules and significantly enhance the adsorption of preferred molecules at low pressure, setting a new benchmark for not only the simultaneous removal of heavier hydrocarbons from natural gas but also the Xe/Kr separation at ultralow concentration.

   Results and Discussion
  </h2>
  <p>
   ZUL-C1 and ZUL-C2 were synthesized by stirring the DMF solution of H2bpdc (or H2cdc) and AlCl3 6H2O at 433 K for 24 h. The obtained white powder was filtered and washed with DMF and methanol for three times each and then dried and degassed under high vacuum ( < 10 μmHg) at 393 K for 24 h. According to powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data, the main reflection peaks of ZUL-C2 and ZUL-C1 were all slightly shifted to lower diffraction angles after activation, indicating that the pores were slightly contracted after the solvent removal (Figures S3 and S4). The crystal structures were determined using PXRD data (Figures S5-S7 and Tables S1-S3). ZUL-C1 and ZUL-C2 exhibited the same topology, built up from infinite chains of corner-sharing (via OH groups) AlO4(OH)2 octahedra interconnected by bpdc or cdc ligands, forming one-dimensional tunnels of different sizes. Because of the longer length of cdc than bpdc, the sides of the diamond-shaped outline in ZUL-C2 (10.41 Å) are slightly longer than those in ZUL-C1 (9.66 Å), leading to a longer framework diagonal (18.00 Å vs 15.95 Å) and a larger pore aperture (5.35 Å vs 4.33 Å) along the horizontal axis, respectively corresponding to the LCD (largest cavity diameter) of ZUL-2 and the PLD (pore limiting diameter) of ZUL-C1 that were calculated by Zeo++ with a probe radius of 1.82 Å. Nevertheless, as a result of the expanded polycyclic moiety in cdc than in bpdc and an enhanced ligand-ligand attraction, the pore aperture slightly contracted along a vertical axis, resulting in a shorter H-H distance (7.56 Å vs 7.82 Å) and smaller pore size (4.76 Å vs 4.99 Å) along a vertical axis, respectively corresponding to the PLD of ZUL-C2 and LCD of ZUL-C1. Moreover, the cubane moiety also has more dispersed C-H groups than [1.1.1]-propellane, resulting in a contraction of the smallest H H distance between two adjacent ligands from 3.00 Å (in ZUL-C1) to 2.61 Å (in ZUL-C2) (Figures S8-S10). This creates the possibility for the simultaneous improvement of both the van der Waals and hydrogen-bonding/dipolar interactions between the gas molecule and the pore surface at the aliphatic sites or the -OH sites, respectively.

   The permanent porosity of activated ZUL-C2 and ZUL-C1 was confirmed by argon (Ar) adsorption isotherms at 87 K (Figures S11-S14). The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas of ZUL-C1 and ZUL-C2 are 504 and 462 m2 g-1, respectively. The water stability and H2S stability of ZUL-C2 and ZUL-C1 were verified by powder X-ray diffraction (Figures S15 and S16) and adsorption isotherms after the immersion in water for 3 days or the adsorption of H2S (Figures S17-S20). The TGA curves showed that ZUL-C2 and ZUL-C1 were thermally stable until 623 and 523 K, respectively (Figures S21 and S22).
  </p>
  <p>
   Single-component adsorption isotherms for CH4, C2H6, and C3H8 on ZUL-C1 and ZUL-C2 were measured at 273, 298, and 313 K (Figure 3a,b and Figures S23-S28). Results showed that C3H8 isotherms of both materials exhibited a slightly steeper increasing trend than C2H6 and a much steeper increasing trend than CH4. It implies that the affinity of frameworks to guest molecules follows the order of C3H8 > C2H6 ≫ CH4. The higher affinity to C3H8 than C2H6 contributes to a higher C3H8 uptake than C2H6 at low pressures. However, because of the larger size, fewer C3H8 molecules could be accommodated in the limited pore space of ZUL-C2 and ZUL-C1 and this leads to a lower C3H8 uptake (2.52 mmol g-1 in ZUL-C2 and 2.72 mmol g-1 in ZUL-C1) than C2H6 (2.82 mmol g-1 in ZUL-C2 and 2.95 mmol g-1 in ZUL-C1) at atmospheric pressure and 298 K. The corresponding gas occupancy values of C3H8 in ZUL-C1 and ZUL-C2 are 2.15 and 2.36 molecules per unit cell, and those of C2H6 are 2.34 and 2.64 molecules per unit cell, respectively (Table S4), indicating that C2H6 and C3H8 are packed more efficiently within ZUL-C2. The densities of C2H6 and C3H8 in ZUL-C1 are 0.20 and 0.27 g mL-1, and those in ZUL-C2 are 0.22 and 0.29 g mL-1, respectively (Table S5), comparable with those of liquid phases (0.32 and 0.49 g mL-1) at 298 K, further indicating the dense packing of C2H6 and C3H8 in ZUL-C2.
  </p>
  <p>
   On the other hand, despite the same affinity trend in both materials, the C2H6 and C3H8 adsorption isotherms of ZUL-C2 were both much steeper than those of ZUL-C1 at low pressures (Figure S29). At 1 kPa, the C2H6 uptake of ZUL-C2 was 1.16 mmol g-1, surpassing all literature MOFs and 3.2 times as large as that of ZUL-C1 (0.36 mmol g-1) (Figure 3d), and the C3H8 uptake of ZUL-C2 was 1.84 mmol g-1, again surpassing that of ZUL-C1 (1.60 mmol g-1), which demonstrates stronger host-guest interactions in ZUL-C2 than in ZUL-C1. This is supported by the isosteric heat of adsorption (Qst) calculated by the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. (48) The Qst values of C3H8 and C2H6 at nearly zero loading for ZUL-C2 were respectively estimated to be 71 and 45 kJ mol-1, higher than those of ZUL-C1 (54 and 33 kJ mol-1). Meanwhile, the Qst of CH4 was 23 kJ mol-1 in both MOFs (Figures S30 and S31), agreeing with the much lower CH4 uptake and gentler isotherm than C3H8 and C2H6 and implying a high selectivity of C3H8 (C2H6) to CH4, especially for ZUL-C2. Adsorption selectivity is a critical parameter to estimate the adsorption separation efficiency of the material. Considering the low concentration ( < 15%) of C2H6 and C3H8 in natural gas, the ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) selectivity (49) was calculated for C3H8:CH4 = 5:85 and C2H6:CH4 = 10:85 mixtures at 298 K (Figures S32-S34 and Tables S6 and S7). The C3H8/CH4 and C2H6/CH4 selectivities of ZUL-C2 exhibited descending trends in the range of 0-100 kPa and reached as high as 741 and 82 at 100 kPa, respectively, significantly higher than those of ZUL-C1 (158 and 28 kPa). It is worth noting that ZUL-C2 outperforms all existing benchmark porous materials for both C2H6/CH4 selectivity and C3H8/CH4 selectivity under the same condition (Figure 3c and Tables S10 and S11).

   Considering that the kinetic diameter of C2H6 (4.44 Å) is comparable to that of Xe (4.10 Å), we also attempted to apply these two MOFs to the Xe/Kr separation to further demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed strategy (Figures S35-S38). Similar to the alkane case, the Xe adsorption isotherm of ZUL-C2 was also much steeper than that of ZUL-C1 at low pressures (Figure 3e). At 20 kPa, the Xe uptake of ZUL-C2 was 2.05 mmol g-1, higher than that of ZUL-C1 (1.76 mmol g-1). The Qst of Xe increased with the uptake decreasing and reached as high as 28 kJ mol-1 at nearly zero loading for ZUL-C2, also surpassing that of ZUL-C1 (25 kJ mol-1), indicating the stronger Xe affinity at ultralow concentration in ZUL-C2. The Qst values of Kr were estimated to be 22 and 19 kJ mol-1 for ZUL-C2 and ZUL-C1, respectively (Figure S39). The high Xe affinity and the considerable difference in the Qst of Xe and Kr under low loading make ZUL-C2 a promising adsorbent with great potential for Xe/Kr separation at extremely dilute concentrations. Furthermore, Henry's selectivity was calculated based on adsorption isotherms measured in the low-pressure range (0-5 kPa, related to the UNF reprocessing off-gas) at 298 K. ZUL-C2 exhibited an outstanding Xe/Kr Henry's selectivity of 19.0, which was far superior to ZUL-C1 (8.7). In addition, the IAST selectivity of Xe:Kr = 20:80 (related to the air-separation byproduct) for ZUL-C2 was calculated to be 19.1, also exhibiting great improvement over ZUL-C1 (11.7) (Figure S40). Given that the actual separation performance is limited by both adsorption selectivity and uptake capacity, the good balance between Xe/Kr (20:80, v/v) selectivity and Xe capacity allows ZUL-C2 to also have an ideal performance in separation applications with higher feed concentration (Figure 3f and Table S12).

   To provide insight into the relationship between the pore environment and the adsorption behavior of alkanes and noble gases, the local surface electrostatic potentials were calculated. As shown in Figures S41 and S42, the electron-rich carbonyl oxygen coordinated to the metal exhibits a negative electrostatic potential, while the aliphatic rings present a positive electrostatic potential, generating a micro-electric field on the pore surface that is conducive to the polarization of the guest molecules. First-principle dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT-D) calculations (50,51) were performed to ascertain the adsorption sites in these MOFs and calculate corresponding binding energies. As expected from the adsorption experiments, different alkanes have a substantial discrepancy in binding energy, which followed the trend C3H8 > C2H6 > CH4 in both ZUL-C1 and ZUL-C2. The optimized adsorption sites of CH4 molecules were at the center of channels in both materials (Figure S43). Due to the small molecular size, the C-H O distance between CH4 and frameworks is not close enough to form strong interactions (3.37 Å in ZUL-C1 and 3.28 Å in ZUL-C2), exhibiting similar binding energies of 28.46 and 29.39 kJ mol-1, respectively. C2H6 was arranged along the shorter diagonal of the diamond-shaped hole with two methyl groups close to the metal chain. In ZUL-C1, two C-H O hydrogen bonds were observed between C2H6 and the carboxylate group (3.11 Å), and a weak C H-O interaction was formed between the hydroxyl group on the metal chain and C2H6 (2.75 Å) (Figure 4a). As for ZUL-C2, the shrinkage of pores along the shorter diagonal made the metal chain closer to C2H6. The distances of C-H O (3.05, 3.09, and 3.10 Å) and C H-O (2.44 Å) interactions are all shortened (Figure 4d), which led to the higher binding energy of 52.95 kJ mol-1 in ZUL-C2 than in ZUL-C1 (49.03 kJ mol-1). With a larger molecular size, C3H8 was slightly tilted in the pores so as to reduce the steric hindrance and maximize its interaction with the pore surface. The methyl groups of C3H8 were close to the aliphatic bridged polycyclic hydrocarbon moieties, contributing to the formation of multiple van der Waals interactions. Similar to C2H6, C3H8 also had stronger and more C-H O hydrogen bonds with the electronegative oxygen atoms in ZUL-C2 (2.76, 2.86, and 2.96 Å) than in ZUL-C1 (2.80 Å) (Figure 4b,e). In addition, owing to the abundant alkyl sites of the cdc ligand, more C-H C van der Waals interactions were generated in ZUL-C2 (2.84, 2.94, 2.98, and 3.07 Å) than in ZUL-C1 (3.06 Å), causing higher binding energy between ZUL-C2 and C3H8 (78.99 kJ mol-1 vs 72.32 kJ mol-1).
  </p>
  <p>
   As for the Xe atom, Xe H van der Waals interactions were formed between Xe and the polar hydroxyl group of the metal chain in ZUL-C1 (3.38 Å) and ZUL-C2 (3.39 Å) (Figure 4c,f), which were both shorter than the average Xe H distances reported in the leading organic cage CC3 (3.71 Å). The confined pore of ZUL-C2 led to shorter average Xe O bonds than that in ZUL-C1 (4.3 Å vs 4.6 Å), resulting in the higher binding energy of 37.4 kJ mol-1 in ZUL-C2 than in ZUL-C1 (34.0 kJ mol-1). Because of its smaller size and weaker polarizability, Kr exhibited a weaker interaction with frameworks than Xe whether in ZUL-C1 or ZUL-C2. The Kr adsorption sites are similar to that of Xe but with longer Kr H distances (3.71 Å in ZUL-C1 and 3.98 Å in ZUL-C2), leading to lower binding energies of 26.0 kJ mol-1 in ZUL-C1 and 26.7 kJ mol-1 in ZUL-C2 (Figure S44).

   To validate the practical CH4/C2H6/C3H8 and Xe/Kr separation performance of these new materials, breakthrough experiments were conducted on ZUL-C2 and ZUL-C1 at 298 K. The results for CH4/C2H6/C3H8 (85:10:5, v/v/v) mixtures showed that CH4 penetrated immediately in both MOFs, whereas C2H6 was retained for 146 min g-1 on ZUL-C1 and for 318 min g-1 on ZUL-C2 (Figure 5a). Consequently, the CH4 productivity ( > 99.9999% purity) was increased from 5.42 to 11.4 mmol g-1, which surpasses most of literature MOFs and is only slightly lower than Ni(TMBDC)(DABCO)0.5 (13.28 mmol g-1) (Figure S45). It was worth noting that the C3H8 breakthrough time in ZUL-C2 (742 min g-1) was still longer than that in ZUL-C1 (535 min g-1), demonstrating that compared to ZUL-C1, ZUL-C2 achieved an all-round improvement in the separation performance of the CH4/C2H6/C3H8 (85:10:5, v/v/v) mixture. The accurate dynamic gas uptakes were calculated from desorption processes conducted at 323 K as shown in Figures S46 and S47. CH4 was barely adsorbed in both MOFs ( < 0.001 mmol g-1), indicating the dynamic exclusion of CH4 by ZUL-C1 and ZUL-C2. With a flow rate of 4-6 mL min-1 N2 introduced, both C2H6 and C3H8 adsorbed can be fully desorbed at 323 K, with the dynamic adsorption capacities of 0.269 and 1.90 mmol g-1 for ZUL-C1 and 0.175 and 1.92 mmol g-1 for ZUL-C2, respectively. It should be noted that despite a longer breakthrough time of C2H6 in ZUL-C2, there was less residual C2H6 in ZUL-C2 at equilibrium. This was ascribed to the larger adsorption heat difference between C3H8 and C2H6 in ZUL-C2 than that in ZUL-C1, leading to more significant competitive adsorption. More C2H6 was subsequently replaced by C3H8, causing a higher "roll-up" peak of C2H6 breakthrough curves in ZUL-C2 and ultimately less C2H6 and more C3H8 left in ZUL-C2 than in ZUL-C1. In addition, breakthrough experiments for CH4/C2H6/C3H8 (85:10:5, v/v/v) mixtures were also conducted under saturated moisture ( ~ 3 and ~5%) as shown in Figure S48. Although the breakthrough times of C3H8 and C2H6 were both advanced in the presence of water, ZUL-C2 still exhibited good separation performance with only a slight reduction in CH4 productivity (3% moisture: 10.9 mmol g-1; 5% moisture: 10.1 mmol g-1), which is positive for practical application.
  </p>
  <p>
   For Xe/Kr separation, breakthrough experiments under diluted Xe and Kr concentrations that mimic the off-gas of UNF reprocessing (400 ppm Xe, 40 ppm Kr, 21% O2, and 0.91% Ar, balanced with N2) were conducted. As shown in Figure 5c,d, N2, O2, and Ar all broke through the column immediately as the target gas was injected, then followed by Kr. The Xe eluted after 222 min g-1 with a total Xe capture capacity of 27.4 mmol kg-1 in ZUL-C2 not only surpassed that in ZUL-C1 (94 min g-1, 10.5 mmol kg-1) but also outperformed all literature MOFs as shown in Figure 5b and Table S13. For the Xe/Kr (20:80, v/v) mixture, there was also a significant improvement on the separation performance of ZUL-C2 in comparison with ZUL-C1 (Figure S49). Kr was quickly eluted, while Xe was retained for 118 min g-1 in ZUL-C1 and 180 min g-1 in ZUL-C2. The good balance between Xe/Kr (20:80, v/v) selectivity and Xe capacity (20 kPa) allows ZUL-C2 to also have an exciting separation performance for the Xe/Kr (20:80, v/v) mixture, exhibiting the highest Kr productivity (5.54 mmol g-1) among reported MOFs (Figure S50). Furthermore, multiple breakthrough tests revealed that ZUL-C2 maintained high selectivity and capacity in both CH4/C2H6/C3H8 and Xe/Kr separation (Figures S51-S55), indicating its recyclability and stable separation performance.

   Conclusions
  </h2>
  <p>
   This study demonstrated the considerable potential of the quasi-three-dimensional pore refinement strategy based on polycycloalkane-dicarboxylate ligands. From ZUL-C1 to ZUL-C2, the increase in ring number and moiety volume in the cdc ligand effectively reduces the dimension of the accessible pore space in a specific direction and forms a contoured pore surface with more alkyl sites, realizing the simultaneous enhancement of both the van der Waals and hydrogen-bonding/dipolar interactions that guarantee C2H6, C3H8, and Xe molecules firmly grasped within the framework. As indicated by adsorption isotherms and breakthrough curves, ZUL-C2 exhibits record C2H6/CH4 and C3H8/CH4 selectivities, record low-pressure C2H6 uptakes, record Xe capture capability from the nuclear reprocessing off-gas, and record Kr productivity for the Xe/Kr (20:80, v/v) mixture. With exceptional separation performance and good stability against air, water, and heat, ZUL-C2 is a promising candidate for both CH4/C2H6/C3H8 and Xe/Kr separation. The significant improvement of separation performance in ZUL-C2 also indicates the significance of the proposed strategy, encouraging more research studies to apply it in pore size and environment refinement for different challenging applications.
