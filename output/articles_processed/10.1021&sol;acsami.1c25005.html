   High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideEfficient purification of ethylene (C2H4) from ethane (C2H6) is a crucial but daunting task for the chemical industry given their similar physical natures and molecular dimensions. Reversed capture of C2H6 from C2H6/C2H4 dual-mixtures can be expected to directly yield high-purity C2H4 through a one-step separation unit, but it remains a daunting challenge. Here, we skillfully target an unusual "electrostatic-driven linker microrotation" (EDLM) in a Zr-MOF through coupling dual-ligands having electron-withdrawing/donating groups (e.g.. F and CH3 motifs). EDLM triggered microrotation of linker geometry and screening sites not only enhanced structural rigidity and hydrophobic nature, etc.. but also effectively purified C2H4 through reversely trapping C2H6. Under ambient conditions, 1 kg of activated 2 adsorbents directly produces 7.2 L of C2H4 with over 99.9%+ purity in a single breakthrough operation starting from the equimolar C2H6/C2H4 cracked mixtures. Geometrical models and simulations have revealed that EDLM-derived H-bonding interaction and microrotation of linker geometry, synergistically customized C2H6-selective screening sites and pore inert for reversed C2H6 capture and improved surface hydrophobicity. Adsorption isotherms, modeling simulations, and breakthrough tests based on pressure swing adsorption (PSA) conditions have jointly elucidated the underlying separation properties for C2H4 purification. The enhanced hydrophobic nature, cycling durability, and separation property awarded 2 a new benchmark adsorbent to purify the olefin/paraffin mixtures.

   Introduction
  </h2>
  <p>
   As the most crucial raw material for the production of polymers and high-value organic chemicals, ethylene (C2H4) is generally produced via steam cracking and thermal decomposition of naphtha or ethane (C2H6). (1) The well-developed separation unit (cryogenic high-pressure distillation operation) to purify C2H4 from C2H6/C2H4 mixture has been regarded as the most energy consuming operation due to their similar volatilities and sizes (Supporting Information (SI) Table S1), which requires large distillation towers of over 150 trays. Besides, the operating conditions always need to be carried out at lower temperatures of 180-258 K and higher pressures of 5-28 bar, which are very energy consuming (7 GJ t-1) and constitute a notable portion of the ethylene cost. (2) Therefore, the development of low energy consumption and sustainable separation technology to purify C2H4 is highly imperative.
  </p>
  <p>
   The efficient adsorption strategies based on porous adsorbents, through pressure swing adsorption (PSA), temperature swing adsorption (TSA), or membrane, has been deemed as the potential approaches to replace the traditional cryogenic distillation and realize the energy-efficient separation of C2H4/C2H6. (3,4) Although some traditional adsorbents including zeolites (5-7) and carbon-based adsorbents (8) have been explored for C2H4/C2H6 separation, yet they are unsatisfactory in separation operation due to limited adsorption selectivity and low capacity. (1,9) Porous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), (10-14) also known as porous coordination polymers (PCPs), which possessed structural diversity, multifunctional surface, and adjustable pore sizes, (15-17) etc.. have been extensively explored for the C2H4/C2H6 separation. (18) Especially, most MOFs with uncoordinated metal sites have been widely investigated, because the unsaturated hydrocarbons, that is, C2H4 preferentially coordinate with metal sites through metal π-complexation and hereby can purify C2H4 from its saturated C2H6 counterpart. For most of C2H4-selective adsorbents, they exhibited outstanding excellent separation properties for C2H4/C2H6 mixtures. For example, Qian et al. (19) covered that CuI@UiO-66-(COOH)2 with enhanced polar environment could realize separation of C2H4/C2H6 through π-complexation interaction with C2H4, yielding the higher C2H4 selectivity of 80.8, yet exhibited lower C2H4 uptake of 1.86 mmol g-1 at 298 K and 1 bar; Another classical example, Mg-MOF-74, reported by Mahle et al.. (20) also possessed excellent C2H4 separation performance, while the surface area sharply decreased from 1775 to <20 m2 g-1 after exposing Mg-MOF-74 under 40% relative humidity (RH). Especially, the open coordination sites (OMSs) in the channel were easily poisoned when exposed to moisture due to strong moisture sensitivity of OMSs, thus would seriously attenuate the separation performance for trapping the C2H4 target. So, the water stability of materials has always been a neglected academic challenge. In addition to OMSs, the separation mechanism based on molecular sieving seems to be another effective method for C2H4/C2H6 separation. The representative ultramicroporous MOF [Ca(C4O4)(H2O)] covered by Chen et al.. (21) exhibiting rigid channels with the aperture similar to C2H4 yet smaller than C2H6, was demonstrated to be a molecular sieve, favoring the separation of C2H4/C2H6. However, purifying C2H4 from C2H6 through molecular sieving was less than ideal on the basis of energy efficiency because they usually suffered from additional C2H4 desorption step and failed to yield polymer-grade C2H4 purity ( > 99.9%).
  </p>
  <p>
   Evidently, the above-mentioned challenges could be solved through targeting C2H6-selective adsorbents, which not only fulfill the high-purity C2H4 through a single breakthrough operation, but also could economize ca. 40% of energy consumption (0.4-0.6 GJ ton-1 of C2H4) through PSA technology. A pioneering work reported by Li et al. (22) suggested that Fe2(O2)(dobdc) exhibited excellent performance in addressing the reversed C2H6 adsorption, yielding a record C2H6/C2H4 selectivity of 4.4 and polymer-grade C2H4 purity of 99.99%; another commendable paradigm as covered by Zeng et al. (23) revealed that JNU-2 could realize the reversed C2H6 capture from equimolar C2H6/C2H4 mixture through multiple C-H O hydrogen interaction, giving a higher C2H4 productivity of ca. 21.2 L kg-1 and purity of over 99.99%. Although many achievements have been made on this subject, however, the existence of water vapor and associated moisture sensitivity (24) in industrial production are still crucial challenges to be overcome. For example, the benchmark Fe2(O2) (dobdc) was not stable in air/moisture and must be handled in the dry glovebox, which seriously limited its applications. (24) Additionally, such competitive adsorption behavior of water molecules resulted in decreased gas uptake and thus separation performance, as demonstrated by the obvious reduced C2H4 productivity of JNU-2 under 10% RH. (23-25)

  <p>
   In the past few years, Zr-MOF families, as one of the most outstanding water-stable MOFs, have been widely investigated for catalysis (26,27) and drug delivery, (27,28) etc. However, only several C2H6-selective Zr-MOFs species, for example, (Hf)DUT-52a (29) and UiO-66-2CF,3 (30) have been demonstrated for the reversed C2H6 adsorption through enhancing their inert pore surfaces. To be noted, these two examples mainly improved the selective adsorption of targeted C2H6 by prolonging the length of ligands and the number of benzene rings, but that could not guarantee longstanding structure stability, especially in a long-term aqueous solution. Besides, for most MOF adsorbents reported so far, microrotation of linker geometry caused by electrostatic coupling has not been reported to further enhance pore inertia, but it actually exists in some MOF structures.
  </p>
  <p>
   With the above concerns in mind, we now report for the first time an unusual "Electrostatic-driven linker microrotation" (EDLM) in a MOF for effective C2H4 purification through achieving reversed C2H6 capture. The conformation changes of linker geometries triggered by EDLM can be judiciously constructed through coupling dual-ligands having electron-withdrawing/donating groups (e.g.. F and CH3 moieties). Importantly, EDLM awarded the decent pore microenvironment with hydrogen-bonding screening sites and enhanced nonpolar/inert pore nature, thus achieving improved hydrophobic surface and reversed C2H6 adsorption (Scheme 1). Single-component adsorption isotherms showed that 2 exhibited an enhanced C2H6 uptake of 3.06 mmol g-1 and a moderate Qst of ca. 30.1 kJ mol-1 at lower pressure, indicating a feasible regeneration operation. Selectivity analysis showed that 2 possessed a larger C2H6/C2H4 uptake ratio of 134% and IAST selectivity of 3.0 for an equimolar C2H6/C2H4 cracked gas at 298 K at near-zero coverage, confirming the reversed C2H6 adsorption behavior. The excellent C2H6/C2H4 separation performance were further demonstrated by experimental column breakthrough tests, even in the presence of moisture containing 1000 ppm of H2O for multiple regeneration tests. Modeling calculations including quantum-mechanical calculations and molecule dynamics, etc.. have cooperatively verified the reversed adsorption mechanism for trapping C2H6 molecule. This work proposed a tactful strategy to structure an enhanced nonpolar/inert pore characteristic, awarding 2 a new benchmark adsorbent in enriching water-stable Zr-MOF family and addressing the formidable challenges on direct purification of C2H4.

  <h2>
   Characterizations
  </h2>
  <p>
   The morphologies and microstructural analyses were analyzed through a SEM machine. X-ray powder diffraction spectra were collected by a XRD diffractometer (Diffractometer D8 Advance- BrukeraXS) with Cu Kα emission at 298 K. Pore structure analysis were determined through N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms at 77 K (ASAP 2460). Single-component adsorption measurements of C2H6 and C2H4 were recorded on a Micromeritic ASAP 2020 analyzer. In detail, about ~100 mg of MOF materials was loaded in a sample tube and further activated for 12 h at ~373 K.

  <h2>
   Synthesis of Pristine Zr-MOF and Isostructural Analogues
  </h2>
  <p>
   The synthesis methods of MOFs were according to the reported solvothermal approach with slight modifications. In detail, ZrCl4 (2 mmL), terephthalic acid (2 mmol), and 15 mL of DMF were first mixed and then a sonication procedure was executed for a certain time to form a homogeneous solution. Subsequently, the acetic acid was used as the modulation agent and added into solution to boost the crystal nucleus growth. The obtained mixture was transferred into the Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 393 K for 20 h. The yielded product was centrifuged and washed with methanol several times to remove residual impurities. The dried as-synthesized material was activated in a vacuum oven at 373 K for 10 h and denoted as 1. Similarly, for the synthesis of isostructural Zr-MOF having the double-ligands, terephthalic acid (2 mmol) was replaced by L1 (1 mmol) and L2 (1 mmol), and the other experimental procedures were kept similar as that of 1. Then, the dried as-synthesized samples were activated at 373 K for 10 h in vacuum atmosphere and denoted as 2.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Stability under Humidity Circumstances
  </h2>
  <p>
   To probe the structural stability of samples in certain humidity, the activated MOFs were placed in under moist conditions, and the relative humidity (RH) was kept at a value of 80% for 1 week at 298 K. RH was kept at 80% through placing saturated potassium bromide solution. (31) Afterward, the stability of MOFs was further tested by PXRD methods to verify its structural stability.

   Column Breakthrough Experiments
  </h2>
  <p>
   The dynamic breakthrough tests were conducted in a customized gas breakthrough setup with the stainless column (4.0 mm inner diameter ×150 mm). In a typical breakthrough experiment for C2H6/C2H4 (50/50 and 10/90; v/v) gas mixtures, activated microcrystalline sample of 2 (1.8 g) was packed in the stainless-steel column, and absorbent cotton was used to seal the ends of the steel column, then the sorbent was activated in situ in the column at 373 K for 10 h. A helium flow (10 mL min-1) was introduced to purify adsorbent and pipelines, and rate of mixtures were set to be 2 mL min-1. The effluent gas stream from the column was monitored using gas chromatography with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).

  <h2>
   Crystal Modeling and Pore Geometry Analysis
  </h2>
  <p>
   The optimized topology structures of 1 and 2 (SI Figure S1a,b and Table S2) with the lowest steady-state energy differences were used as the initial full structure for subsequent analysis and calculation. Careful inspection of the optimized pore geometry in Figure 1a,b revealed that selected dual-ligands not only served as H-bonding acceptor (e.g.. featuring F moiety) to increase the recognition sites for screening C2H6, but also synergistically enhanced the inert pore surface through affiliated methyl groups (also called methylation). Importantly, optimized geometry modeling showed that the resultant intermolecular-electrostatic attraction effects between adjacent F and CH3 groups could induce a subtle microrotation of linker geometry, rendering the inert benzene ring units to tilt toward the pore center/centroid of the channel, with a reduced deviation angle of 9° (Figure 1a,b). Simulated surface electronic potential of MOF cluster also confirmed the resultant electrostatic interaction effect. Obviously, their existed a syncretic electron density between F and CH3 groups, confirming the yielding intermolecular electrostatic attraction effects (Figure 1c). As a result, the microrotation of benzene linker would strengthen the nonpolar pore environment and favor the reversed C2H6/C2H4 separation. Besides, to investigate the actual molar ratio of double ligands in 2 skeleton, we conducted the 1H NMR tests. As obviously analyzed in SI Figure S4, the 1H NMR pattern of 2 having double-ligands showed the integrated patterns and signals in comparison with that of the single ligand (SI Figures S2 and S3), indicating that the coordination environment of 2 was undisturbed. Besides, we also obtained the H atomic ratio through integrating the 1H NMR peaks. Apparently, the element ratio of H in the benzene ring in L1 to that in L2 was determined to be 0.98, being consistent with the experimental value of 1, suggesting that L1 and L2 had been implanted in the skeleton of 2 topology.

   Surface Morphologies and Crystalline Structure Analysis
  </h2>
  <p>
   Figure 2a,b exhibited the microstructure and digital photographs of water contact angle (WCA) over the prepared materials. Apparently, 2 inherited the original octahedral morphology and monodispersed characteristics (Figure 2b) in comparison with that of prototypical 1 (Figure 2a). To be noted, it disclosed the rough outer surface features for 2 (Figure 2b), which looked like undulating hills or lotus leaves, indicative of enhanced hydrophobic attribute. Such results could be intuitively visualized through visible digital photographs of static WCA. Expectedly, 2 present pessimistic water wettability with a higher WCA of 122.4° (inset in Figure 2b), confirming the laudatory hydrophobic nature. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) tests were conducted to probe the yielding crystalline structure. Apparently, 1 and 2 showed quasi-consistent diffraction patterns in comparison with that of simulated Zr-MOF prototype (32) (Figure 2c,d), suggesting an intact isostructural structure having face-centered-cubic symmetry and exhibiting the Fm-3m space group. By comparison, the refined cell volumes between 1 and 2 afforded ΔV/V value of 0.10% (SI Table S3), which were far below than that of rigid MOF-5 (0.8%) covered by Yaghi et al. (33,38) The imperceptible cell volume differences ensured the enhanced structure rigidity of 2, although indirectly. To verify the thermal stability, we conducted the variable-temperature PXRD experiments to probe the changes of cell parameters. As shown in SI Figure S5a, it suggested that there were no obvious shifts for 2, revealing the lattice rigidity and structure stability. Further, the refined cell volumes of 2 at 298 K (SI Figure S5b) and 523 K (SI Figure S5c) yielded ΔV/V value of 0.07% (SI Table S3). Visually, the derived cell structure of 2 at 523 K experienced the quasi-unchanged conformation deformations (SI Figure S5d) in comparison with that of 2 at 298 K, evidently confirming the enhanced structure rigidity. We further investigate the influences of humidity on structural stability. Obviously, after exposing to humid circumstance for 1 week with a RH of 80%, the spectra of sample 1 appeared to be coarse and weakened, while that of 2 could still remain the structural integrity (SI Figure S6), confirming that the hydrophobic surface character could be precisely engineered through judiciously confining the task-specific groups in the pore pocket.

  <h2>
   Gas Adsorption Properties and Selectivity Analysis
  </h2>
  <p>
   The eternal porosities of selected 1 and 2 were established through N2 gas adsorption tests at 77 K. As obviously observed, 2 paradigm could adsorb a large amount of N2, yielding a N2 uptake of 280 cm3 g-1 at 298 K and 1 bar, which was slighter lower than that of 1 (310 cm3 g-1) (Figure 3a). The reduced N2 uptakes were mainly derived from the occupation of F and CH3 entities in the confined pore space which slightly reduced the pore volume. The derived pore distribution using Horvath-Kawazoe model also suggests an ultramicropore aperture of ca. 5.8 Å (SI Figure S7). We further collected the single-gas isotherms of gas molecule on 2 at 273 and 298 K up to 1 bar. As is clearly revealed in Figure 3b,c, 2 exhibited a distinguishing adsorption steepness and reversed adsorption of C2H6 over C2H4 at both temperatures. The preferential adsorption capacity of C2H6 over 2 was up to 3.06 mmol g-1 (68.5 cm3 g-1), being notably higher than that of C2H4 (2.28 mmol g-1) (51.1 cm3 g-1) at 298 K and 1 bar. This indicated that C2H6 with higher polarizability could be preferentially captured in the inert pore channel, confirming the unwonted reversed adsorption behavior. Such results were also further confirmed through testing at 273 K (Figure 3c). Combined with the assessed uptake ratio, 2 demonstrated a gratifying C2H6/C2H4 uptake ratio, with a larger value of 134% (SI Table S4) at 298 K and 1 bar, far exceeding the advanced benchmark materials including MUF-15 (113%), (1) ZJU-HOF-1 (121), (34) and LIFM-63 (130), (35) although being slightly inferior in comparison to the advanced ethane-selective Ni(bdc)(ted) (180%) (36) and Cu(Qc)2 (237%) (37) adsorbents.
  </p>
  <p>
   To quantitatively analyze the potential of 2 for 50/50 C2H6/C2H4 mixtures at 298 K, the ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) selectivity (38) was calculated. Here, the adsorption isotherms were initially fitted using double sites Langmuir-Freundlich (DSLF) model to obtain the parameters (SI Figure S8a,b and SI Table S5). As shown in Figure 3d, 2 exhibited notable C2H6/C2H4 adsorption selectivity, giving a value of 3.0 for an equimolar binary mixture at lower pressure. By comparison, the value was lower than the pioneering Fe2(O2) (dobdc) (3.7), (22) Cu(Qc)2 (3.75), (37) but was obviously higher than that of many top-performing C2H6-selective MOFs such as CPM-733 (1.25), (39) MUF-15 (1.96) (40) JNU-2 (1.6) (41) (SI Table S4). When the pressure increased to 1 bar, 2 remained the higher selectivity of 2.5 at 298 K, still surpassing that of other benchmark materials, that is, JXNU-9 (1.7), (42) NUM-7a (1.76), (43) and Fe2(BDP)3 (2.1) (44) (SI Figure S9 and Table S4), etc. Noted that the IAST calculation was just for the qualitative analysis, we thus assessed the value at the 10/90 of C2H6/C2H4 mixtures. Obviously, 2 still inherited the expected selectivity of over 3.0 (Figure 3d) at near-zero coverage, further evidencing its exceptional selectivity. Additionally, we further integrated the comprehensive comparison of the adsorption capacity and selectivity of C2H6. Remarkably, 2 laid in the "crown" level (Figure 3e), suggesting that 2 could effectively overcome the insurmountable "trade-off" effects. The isosteric heat of adsorption (Qst), an indicator that reflected the binding affinity between adsorbents and adsorbates, (4) was further determined using virial method (SI Figure S10-S13). Obviously, the Qst of C2H6 for 2 was calculated to be ca. 30.1 kJ mol-1 at lower pressure, which was higher than that of C2H4 (23.3 kJ mol-1) (Figure 3f). To be noted, attributed to the absence of OMS in 2, this Qst value of C2H6 is obviously lower than that in the most C2H6-selective materials, for example, Fe2(O2)(dobdc) (66.8 kJ mol-1), (22) IRMOF-8 (54 kJ mol-1) (45) and MAF-49 (61 kJ mol-1) (46) (SI Table S4). The lower adsorption enthalpy evidently suggested the potential advantages to regenerate this MOF under moderate conditions, reducing the regenerative energy consumption for C2H6 desorption.

  <h2>
   Pore Geometry and Diffusion Analysis
  </h2>
  <p>
   To obtain an in-depth cognition of spatial pore configuration, the accessible connolly representation was carefully analyzed. Obviously, for the pristine pore geometry of 1, it suggested two classical "accessible-windows" (denoted as elliptic and rhombic shapes) (Figure 4a), while that of 2 present a contracted pore dimension (Figure 4b) in a static view. The conformation changes in pore geometry were conducive to the constructure diffusion energy barrier, which inspired us to study the diffusion of guest molecules when they diffused into the pore channels. We subsequently conducted time-dependent kinetic adsorptions measurements at 298 K and 0.1 bar. As clearly seen in Figure 4c, 2 could reach the saturated capacity in a very short time at 298 K and 0.1 bar, suggesting a faster kinetic adsorption behavior. Further, the derived microporous diffusion model (7) was used for quantificationally investigating the kinetic diffusion behaviors. The calculated diffusion coefficient of 2 based on the fitting slope (Figure 4d) showed a higher value of 1.25 × 10-16 m2 s-1 for C2H6, nearly 22.4 times higher than that of pristine 1 (5.58 × 10-18 m2 s-1) (SI Table S6). Yet, that of C2H4 only increased from 7.80 × 10-18 m2 s-1 on 1 to 1.45 × 10-17 m2 s-1 on 2 (SI Table S6). Consequently, the assessed kinetic diffusion selectivity (DM,C2H6/DM,C2H4) on 2 was calculated to be 8.6, which was 12.3 times higher than that of 1 (0.7), indicating the fast kinetic diffusion rate for C2H6 but a lower diffusion rate for C2H4 molecules when entering into the pore channels. Consequently, the diffusion behavior triggered by EDLM could exert an indispensable effect for the kinetic separation of C2H6/C2H4. Such diffusion process was obvious compared with that in 298 K and 0.2 bar (SI Figure S14a,b and Table S6), demonstrating the faster diffusion behavior could be easily happen in lower pressure.
  </p>
  <p>
   Further, DFT and MD simulations were adopted to deeply investigate the effects of ligand microrotation on ethane adsorption and diffusion behavior. Here, we first select three lower-energy geometry configurations produced from the structural optimization of 2 topology, and denoted as G1, G2, and G3 (SI Table S7), among which G3 represents the most stable geometry configuration with the lowest steady-state energy. It should be noted that, in order to intuitively reflect the microrotation of ligands in these three structures, the fixed benzene ring was selected as the reference and further revealed its geometry microrotation by measuring the deviation angle between the vertical line in this benzene center and the two central lines connected through the pore centroid and benzene center (SI Table S7). Obviously, all the fixed benzene in G1-3 structures exhibited different degrees of geometry microrotation, especially for G3 with lowest-energy geometry configuration which possessed a larger deviation angle of 9°.
  </p>
  <p>
   Besides, we carried out MD simulations to analyze the diffusion behavior induced by ligand microrotation and visualize the differences when guests diffused in the channels of 1, G1 and G3. Obviously, in comparison with comparable 1, the effects of dual-ligands and triggered EDLM exerted an important role on the adsorption conformation of ethane before and after entering the pore channel (SI Figures S15-S17). Especially for C2H6-loaded G3, two guest molecules could be comfortably confined in the pore space of G3 when steadily staying in the cavity (SI Figure S17); while that in 1 and G1 appeared to be escaping from the pore pocket (SI Figures S15-S16). Such differences evidently confirmed the decent pore microenvironment and advantages triggered by EDLM, which would be favorable for ethane diffusion.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Adsorption Conformation and Binding Mechanism
  </h2>
  <p>
   Inspired by the enhanced capacity of C2H6 on 2, we run GCMC simulations and quantum mechanical calculations to accurately analyze the adsorption conformation and binding mechanism of C2H6. As explicated in the simulative adsorption isotherms, the uptake of C2H6 and C2H4 on 2 were 65.4 cm3 g-1 (2.92 mmol g-1) and 51.7 cm3 g-1 (2.31 mmol g-1) at 298 K and 1 bar (Figure 5a), being consistent with the experimental analysis. Note that the inconformity at low pressures may arise from strong binding forces between C2H6 and pore surface, being knotty to model using given force fields. The calculated energy distribution profiles showed that 2 could form a strong affinity with C2H6 (Figure 5b), affording a theoretical Qst of 30.4 ± 0.4 kJ mol-1, while it was 22.7 ± 0.3 kJ mol-1 for C2H4, further indicating a preferential binding behavior toward C2H6. A close insight into the adsorption conformation of ethane in 2, there were mainly two adsorption sites (termed as site I and II) located in the pore pocket (Figure 5c). One molecule trapped in spatial Site I was tightly grasped through forming van der Waals effects (C-H π), giving the distances of 2.97 Å (Figure 5d). Importantly, two emerging hydrogen bonds (C-H F) between H and adjacent F motifs also enabled the favorable "sweet spots" and contributed to the enhanced interaction forces, with the binding distances of 2.61 and 3.46 Å (Figure 5d), respectively. It was worth noting that the C═C axis of the C2H6 molecule adsorbed in Site I was linearly along the centroid of the benzene ring at the upper left, yielding the angle of 175.5° (Figure 5e). The favorable adsorption configuration in Site I would facilitate its interaction affinity with the decent pore pocket through its spatial van der Waals contacts (C-H π) with linkers. The other C2H6 adsorbed in Site II was well confined through forming a strong hydrogen-bonding, giving the distance of 2.56 Å (Figure 5f). Notably, two additional van der Waals interactions between methyl motifs and neighboring benzene rings also contributed to specific recognition sites, with binding distances of 3.51 and 3.57 Å (Figure 5f). Although C-H π effects were mainly determined by dispersion, in comparison with the noncovalent interactions including permanent dipoles/quadrupole, the decent pore environment having enhanced nonpolar/inert property of 2 complemented the size of C2H6 to prompt helpful C-H π interactions. Conversely, for optimized conformation of C2H4 2, it showed only a binding conformation in the pore center, presenting a trapeze-like hanging through forming the H-bonding interaction (3.27 and 2.46 Å) (SI Figure S18a,b). Consequently, the lower interaction affinity was due to the absence of strong screening sites in the channels and the limited number of C-H π effects.

   Column Breakthrough Tests

  <p>
   To evaluate the separation performance and feasibility of adsorbents in actual industrial conditions, we examined the dynamic breakthrough tests of binary components. Here, the C2H6/C2H4 mixtures with a concentration of 50/50 (v/v) and 10/90 (v/v) were introduced over the customized column of the activated 2 (1.8 g) at 298 K and 1 bar (SI Figure S19). As obviously seen in Figure 6a, the breakthrough curves suggested that 2 could efficiently realize the efficient separation of 50/50 C2H6/C2H4 under ambient conditions. Besides, C2H4 eluted through the bed first to yield an outflow of pure gas with no detectable C2H6. On the contrary, C2H6 was more efficiently adsorbed by activated 2, contributing to the prolonged breakthrough time of 57.3 min g-1 for a single separation operation (Figure 6a), which exceeded the advanced MOFs including LIFM-63 (25), (47) MIL-142A (40) (48) and MUF-15 (18) (36) (SI Table S8), etc. In realistic conditions, the concentration of C2H6 byproduct in C2H6/C2H4 mixtures produced by naphtha cracking was about 6-10%. (22) We hereby conducted the breakthrough tests on 10/90 C2H6/C2H4 mixture at same conditions. As visualized in Figure 6b, 2 still remained the quasi-identical breakthrough trend, furthering confirming the potential separation natures. In industrial operation units, two significant indicators for understanding C2H4 purification performance were C2H4 purity and productivity, which can be obtained by quantitatively calculating from the testing curves of a 50/50 C2H6/C2H4 mixture. Expectedly, it suggested that 7.2 L of polymer-grade C2H4 with >99.9% purity can be straightforwardly obtained from the equimolar C2H6/C2H4 cracking mixtures for 1 kg of 2 adsorbent in a single breakthrough test (Figure 6c). By a further comparison, 2 could preferably realize record-high C2H4 productivity with over 99.9% purity for Zr-MOF families, albeit being paled in comparison with the laudable precedents, for example, JNU-2 (21.2 L kg-1) (49) and MUF-15 (14 L kg-1). (36) Further, the captured amount of C2H6 and C2H4 adsorbed in the column of activated 2 obtained from breakthrough curves was calculated to be 66.8 and 24.4 L kg-1. Consequently, the resultant dynamic separation selectivity, an unnoticed but crucial indicator that denoted the separation property, was calculated to be 2.74 for 50/50 C2H6/C2H4, which was superior than that of benchmark COF-1 (1.44), MCOF-1 (1.39), and PCN-250 (1.4) (50) etc.. confirming the excellent separation performance.

   To be noted, preferable recycling performance and water resistance were important requirements for a desirable adsorbent in actual separations. Obviously, 2 still showed laudable separation performance after five cycles (Figure 6d), and its breakthrough curves remained unchanged even in the presence of H2O(g) (1000 ppm). In addition, the adsorption isotherms of C2H6 on 2 after the cycling tests further demonstrated the endurance of C2H6 capture (Figure 6e).

   Process Simulation
  </h2>
  <p>
   Pressure swing adsorption (PSA) process is an important unit operation in actual industrial process and have been extensively investigated for gas separation and purification. In order to further imitate the industrial separation potential under pressure swing adsorption (PSA) conditions, we adopted the Aspen Adsorption module to obtain simulated transient packed-bed breakthrough curves of C2H6/C2H4 under higher pressures (Detailed configurations for breakthrough simulations are available in SI Figure S20 and Table S9). First, the mass transfer coefficients for the imitative separation process were obtained through matching the experimental and simulated data. We thereby predicted the breakthrough tests using feed ratios of 50/50 C2H6/C2H4 mixtures at different pressures (Figure 6f). Obviously, 2 could retain the preferable adsorption potential of C2H6 and upgrading the purity of nature gas, even under higher pressure of 5 bar as usually required in industrial settings.

   Conclusions
  </h2>
  <p>
   In summary, we targeted a novel "electrostatic-driven linker microrotation" (EDLM) within a MOF for preferable C2H6 adsorption. EDLM triggered conformation changes of linkers could be judiciously constructed through integrating dual-ligands having H-bonding acceptor and inert moieties to enhance structural rigidity, hydrophobic natures and durable cyclicity, etc. The reduction in pore polarity triggered by EDLM could cooperate with H-bonding acceptor to synergistically boost the reversed capture of C2H6, giving an enhanced C2H6 capacity of 3.06 mmol g-1 (68.5 cm3 g-1) and higher C2H6/C2H4 uptake ratio of 134, exceeding than that of most MOFs. Under ambient conditions, 1 kg of 2 paradigm directly produces 7.2 L of C2H4 with 99.9%+ purity in a single breakthrough operation starting from an equimolar C2H6/C2H4 cracked mixtures, even in the presence of 1000 ppm of H2O(g). The excellent C2H6/C2H4 separation performance were revealed by dynamic breakthrough tests, and modeling simulations, for example, density functional theory (DFT), and molecule dynamics (MD).
