   Abstract
  </h2>
  <p>
   High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideA novel metal-organic framework (MOF) of [Co8(OH)4(TCA)4(H2O)4]n (abbreviation: JXNU-9) based on the unique octanuclear Co8(μ3-OH)4 clusters linked by 4,4′,4″-nitrilotribenzoate (TCA3-) ligands featuring small caged structures and one-dimensional channels was prepared and characterized. JXNU-9 shows a high C2H6 uptake capacity of 3.60 mmol g-1 (4.46 mmol cm-3) at 298 K and 1 atm with a small isosteric heat of adsorption (23.6 kJ mol-1) and a moderate C2H6/C2H4 adsorption selectivity of 1.7, resulting in excellent C2H6/C2H4 separation performance. The pore walls decorated by plenty of aromatic rings provide π-electron-cloud-surrounding environments to accommodate the large polarizable C2H6 molecules. The calculations demonstrate that the rich π-systems in JXNU-9 facilitate an adsorption affinity for large C2H6 molecules through multiple C-H π interactions. Additionally, the open metal sites located in the concave pores with a close Co Co separation (4.21 Å) in octanuclear Co8(μ3-OH)4 clusters make the open metal sites inaccessible for the C2H4 molecule with a kinetic diameter of 4.163 Å. Thus, the annihilation of open metal sites in this structure is achieved, which further facilitates the C2H6-selective C2H6/C2H4 separation.

   Introduction
  </h2>
  <p>
   Ethylene (C2H4), which is widely utilized for the production of many important fine chemicals such as polyethylene, epoxy ethane, and styrene, is one of the most vital chemical feedstocks in the world. The global ethylene production capacity reached 180 million tons in 2018, and the demand for ethylene could grow rapidly. Ethylene is generally generated by the cracking of ethane (C2H6) at elevated temperatures, leading to a certain amount of ethane in the ethylene product. As a result, the removal of the residual ethane from the ethylene product is a critical process in the petrochemical industry. However, the separation of C2H4 and C2H6 is one of the most challenging industrial separations because of their similar molecular sizes (3.8 × 4.1 × 4.8 and 3.3 × 4.2 × 4.8 Å3 for C2H6 and C2H4, respectively) and physicochemical properties (Table S1 in Supporting Information). (1-3) Current technology for C2H6/C2H4 separation mainly relies on cryogenic distillation with more than 100 column trays, which is an energy-intensive process due to the use of high pressure and low temperature. (4-6) Thus, the development of the energy-saving technology for C2H6/C2H4 separation under ambient conditions is urgently needed.
  </p>
  <p>
   Adsorptive separation by porous solid adsorbents is regarded as a promising approach for industrial separation. The conventional porous materials of zeolites generally exhibit preferential binding affinity for C2H4 over C2H6. (7,8) This is mainly because of the zeolites with immobilized metal sites on the pore surfaces, which afford the preferential binding sites for the C2H4 molecule with a large quadrupole moment (1.50 × 10-26 esu cm2 for C2H4 and 0.65 × 10-26 esu cm2 for C2H6). On the other hand, for the production of polymer-grade C2H4 from the C2H4-selective adsorbents, an additional desorption step for the release of the adsorbed C2H4 molecules is necessary, which is an energy-intensive process with the need for vacuum or high temperature. In contrast, the desirable C2H4 can be directly obtained from a single adsorption cycle from the C2H6-selective adsorbents. C2H6-selective adsorbents with a lower energy cost are inherently more efficient than C2H4-selective adsorbents. MOFs built from metal nodes and organic linkers have been shown to exhibit particular potentials in gas storage and separation. (9-15) The presence of the coordinatively unsaturated metal sites in most of the desolvated MOFs generally results in the C2H4-selective MOFs. (16-19) Moreover, MOFs functionalized with polar groups interact preferentially with the large quadrupole C2H4 molecules. (20,21) Therefore, the C2H4-selective MOFs account for the majority. Only limited C2H6-selective MOFs have been demonstrated. However, the previously reported MOFs commonly suffer from either a low sorption amount for C2H6 resulting from the small pore volume, (22,23) poor separation selectivity, (24,25) or high heat adsorption for regeneration. (26,27)
  </p>
  <p>
   In this paper, a C2H6-selective MOF of [Co8(OH)4(TCA)4(H2O)4]n termed JXNU-9 (JXNU = JiangXi Normal University) with its synthesis, structure, and gas separation performance is presented. JXNU-9 is based on the unique octanuclear Co8(μ3-OH)4 clusters bridged by 4,4′,4″-nitrilotribenzoate ligands and features small cages and 1D channels with the pore walls decorated by aromatic rings. Such distinctive pore environments boost intimate contacts between guest molecules and the pore walls, which means that the dispersion and induction interactions dominate the host-guest interactions. It is known that the dispersion and induction interactions are proportional to the polarizability of gas molecules. (28) On the basis of the the fact that the polarizability of the C2H6 molecule [(44.3-44.7) × 10-25 cm3] is larger than that of the C2H4 molecule (42.52 × 10-25 cm3), (1) JXNU-9 with nonpolar pore walls is expected to be a C2H6-selective MOF.

   Synthesis of [Co8(OH)4(TCA)4(H2O)4]n (JXNU-9)
  </h2>
  <p>
   A mixture of 4,4′,4″-nitrilotribenzoic acid (0.01 mmol, 3.8 mg) and Co(NO3)2 6H2O (0.025 mmol, 7.6 mg) in 3 mL of DMF solvent was stirred for 1 h at room temperature. Then the clear pink solution was transferred into a 20 mL Parr Teflon-lined vessel, which was capped and warmed to 393 K for 3 days. The resulting mixture was cooled to room temperature to give violet rod-shaped crystals (yield 21% based on 4,4′,4″-nitrilotrisbenzoic acid). Elemental analysis for {[Co8(OH)4(TCA)4(H2O)4] 6DMF 2.5H2O}n (C102H107N10O40.5Co8: 2592.44) calcd/found: H, 4.16/4.08; C, 47.25/47.11; N, 5.40/5.21. The violet crystals were obtained as a pure phase indicated by the PXRD pattern (Figure S1). IR data (KBr, cm-1): 3404 (s), 2840 (w), 1655 (m), 1593 (s), 1536 (m), 1504 (w), 1393 (s), 1315 (s), 1280 (m), 1177 (s), 1104 (m), 1014 (w), 838 (w), 783 (s), 713 (w), 674 (s), 631 (w), 524 (m), 445 (w).

   Gas Sorption Studies
  </h2>
  <p>
   Gas adsorption experiments were performed on a Micromeritics ASAP2020 HD88 surface area analyzer. The freshly prepared samples of JXNU-9 were first exchanged with CH2Cl2 for 4 days and then exchanged with dry n-hexane for 2 days (Figure S2). Finally, the samples were filtered and placed under vacuum at 100 °C for 25 h to give the desolvated framework with all of the solvent molecules, including the coordinated water molecules that were lost.

   Structural Description
  </h2>
  <p>
   JXNU-9 is crystallized in space group P42/n (Table 1) and has a three-dimensional (3D) structure based on the octanuclear Co8(μ3-OH)4 clusters and 4,4′,4″-nitrilotribenzoate ligands. The asymmetric unit contains two Co(II) atoms, one TCA3- ligand, one μ3-OH, and one coordinated water molecule. The Co1 atom is six-coordinated by three carboxylate oxygen atoms from three TCA3- ligands, two oxygen atoms of two μ3-OH groups, and one water oxygen atom, leading to octahedral geometry (Figure S3). The Co2 atom is coordinated in tetrahedral geometry with three carboxylate oxygen atoms of three TCA3- ligands and one hydroxyl oxygen atom. The Co-O distances vary from 1.943(3) to 2.167(7) Å with the longest distance associated with the coordinated water molecule (Table S2). As depicted in Figure 1a, four μ3-OH groups bridge four Co1 atoms to give eight-membered rings. Each μ3-OH group is further coordinated to a Co2 atom to generate four-pointed star-like Co8(μ3-OH)4 clusters with Co1 Co2, Co1 Co2C, and Co1 Co1C of 3.141, 3.232, and 3.932 Å (Figure S4), respectively. Many kinds of octanuclear cobalt oxide clusters with diverse structures have been documented. (29,30) The common configurations for octanuclear cobalt oxide clusters are the Co4(μ3-O)4 cubic cluster with four dangling cobalt atoms and three fused Co4(μ3-O)4 cubic clusters sharing the faces (I and II in Figure S4). (31,32) Obviously, the present unique octanuclear cobalt oxide cluster formed from a eight-membered Co4(μ3-O)4 ring and four dangling cobalt atoms is distinct from those of the previously reported octanuclear cobalt oxide clusters (Figure S4). Additionally, almost all of the reported octanuclear cobalt oxide clusters exist in the discrete molecules. Only two polymeric structures constructed from the octanuclear cobalt oxide clusters as the basic units have been documented. (33,34)

   The TCA3- ligand bridges six Co(II) atoms through its six unidentate carboxylate oxygen atoms. Each Co8(μ3-OH)4 cluster is surrounded by 12 TCA3- ligands (Figure S5). As depicted in Figure 1b, two Co8(μ3-OH)4 clusters are bridged by four TCA3- ligands to form a cage with a diameter of about 10 × 6.3 Å2. The neighboring cages share the Co8(μ3-OH)4 clusters to give a 1D columnar secondary building unit (SBU) running along the c axis (Figure 1c). Each 1D columnar SBU links four adjacent 1D columnar SBUs through the TCA3- bridging ligands, giving a 3D framework (Figure 1d). The 3D framework has 1D channels with an aperture of about 12 Å extending to the c axis. The DMF and water solvents fill the 1D channels and account for 59.2% of the unit cell volume.

   Gas Sorption Properties
  </h2>
  <p>
   The N2 adsorption isotherm at 77 K for the desolvated JXNU-9 shows reversible type I adsorption behavior (Figure 2), indicative of the microporous nature. The N2 sorption curve features a sharp rise when the relative pressure (P/P°) is lower than 0.01, with a saturated N2 capacity of 453 cm3 g-1 at 1 atm. The total pore volume of 0.70 cm3 g-1 is close to 0.73 cm3 g-1 calculated from the crystal data. JXNU-9 has Langmuir and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas of 1660 and 1952 m2 g-1 derived from the experimental N2 sorption data (Figure S6). Using the nonlocal density functional theory (NLDFT) mode, the pore size distribution is derived from N2 isotherms, which give diameters of about 6.4, 9.2, and 11.7 Å for the pore cavities (Figure 2 inset), in line with the sizes of the cages and window sizes of the 1D channels from the crystal structure.
  </p>
  <p>
   The single components of C2H6 and C2H4 adsorption behavior were investigated at 273, 283, and 298 K. The gas sorption amounts are enhanced with a decrease in temperature (Figure 3), as a result of the exothermic physical adsorption. As expected, the C2H6 adsorption capacity is evidently larger than that of C2H4 under the same conditions (Figures 3c and S7), indicating that the binding ability order is C2H6 > C2H4. The higher affinity for C2H6 of the framework is also evidenced by the adsorption enthalpies (23.6 and 21.4 kJ mol-1 for C2H6 and C2H4) (Figure 4a) fitted with a virial equation (Figure S8) and the hysteretic profile for C2H6 isotherms (Figure 3c). The maximum C2H6 adsorption capacities for JXNU-9 are 5.81 (273 K), 4.74 (283 K), and 3.61 mmol g-1 (298 K) (Figure 3a). It is worth noting that the C2H6 sorption capacity for JXNU-9 at 298 K and 1 atm is remarkable and only smaller than that of benchmark MOFs of PCN-250 (5.17 mmol g-1) (35) and CPM-233 (7.4 mmol g-1) (36) but surpasses all other C2H6-selective MOFs, such as Fe2(O2)(dobdc) (3.32 mmol g-1), (26) PCN-245 (3.27 mmol g-1), (37) UTSA-33 (2.76 mmol g-1), (23) ZIF-7 (1.85 mmol g-1), (24) and MAF-49 (1.73 mmol g-1). (27) In addition, the volumetric sorption capacity (4.46 mmol cm-3) for JXNU-9 substantially outperforms the top-performing MOFs of azole-Th-1 (3.38 mmol cm-3), (38) MUF-15 (3.76 mmol cm-3), (39) and JNU-2 (3.91 mmol cm-3). (40) The high C2H6 sorption capacity for JXNU-9 resulted from the large pore volume (0.70 cm3 g-1) in comparison to those for other MOFs, such as Cu(Qc)2 (0.11 cm3 g-1), (22) UTSA-33 (0.36 cm3 g-1), (23) JNU-2 (0.56 cm3 g-1), (40) and MUF-15 (0.51 cm3 g-1). (39) Thus, JXNU-9 is one of the top-performing MOFs for C2H6 adsorption. Furthermore, the C2H6 adsorption-desorption cycle can be reproduced over multiple cycles at 298 K (Figure 3d), which is necessary for adsorbents.
  </p>
  <p>
   In contrast to the high C2H6 sorption capacity, JXNU-9 takes up less C2H4 with C2H4 adsorption capacities of 4.45, 3.33, and 2.45 mmol g-1 at 273, 283, and 298 K (Figure 3b), respectively. The uptake ratio of C2H6 and C2H4 at 298 K for JXNU-9 is 1.47 at 1 atm. The uptake ratio at 1 atm for JXNU-9 is higher than those of most MOFs, with uptake ratios of between 1.01 and 1.36, (23-27,35-38) and comparable to those of Ni(bdc)(ted)0.5 (1.47) (41) and IRMOF-8 (1.50). (42) The large uptake ratio and evident difference in sorption amounts between C2H6 and C2H4 endow JXNU-9 with a promising potential for separating C2H6 and C2H4 mixtures.

  <h2>
   C2H6/C2H4 Separation
  </h2>
  <p>
   The ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) was utilized for calculating the adsorption selectivity for binary gas mixtures based on the single-component sorption isotherms. The adsorption isotherms at 273, 283, and 298 K were modeled with single-site Langmuir-Freundlich fits, respectively (Figure S9). The adsorption selectivities for equimolar C2H6 and C2H4 are between 1.53 and 1.7 at 1 atm (Figure S10), which are comparable to those of JNU-2 (1.6), (40) CPM-233 (1.64), (36) ZIF-7(1.7), (24) and [Ni(bdc)(ted)0.5] (1.6). (41) The recorded selectivity of 9 is afforded by MAF-49, (27) but its separation performance is severely lowered by its very low C2H6 sorption capacity (1.72 mmol g-1). [Fe2(O2)(dobdc)] with the peroxo sites for strongly binding C2H6 exhibits a high selectivity of 4 but has a very high adsorption enthalpy (Qst = -66.8 kJ mol-1), (26) which generates a very high energy penalty for regeneration. Thus, JXNU-9 with a high C2H6 sorption capacity, relative low heat of adsorption, and moderate adsorption selectivity is a promising candidate for the separation of the C2H6/C2H4 mixture (Figure 4).
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, the breakthrough experiments in the packed column of activated JXNU-9 samples were examined. Since there is a trace amount of ethane in the ethylene product during the cracking reaction, the 1:99 (v/v) C2H6/C2H4 mixture with a flow rate of 2 mL min-1 was fed into the packed bed at 298 K and 1 atm. The result of the breakthrough experiment showed that the C2H4 gas was first detected in the outlet effluent (Figure 5). The C2H4 breakthrough time is 33 min, and C2H6 was eluted from the packed bed starting from 60 min. Such a result indicates that the efficient separation of C2H4 from the C2H6/C2H4 mixture can be achieved with JXNU-9 material. Thus, the pure C2H4 gas ( > 99.9%) can be obtained from the outlet of the packed column before the C2H6 breakthrough. The C2H6 breakthrough time of JXNU-9 is longer than those of famous MOFs including Cu(Qc) (10 min), (22) and azole-Th-1(34 min), (38) and MUF-15 (18 min) (39) but is shorter than that of JNU-2 (96 min). (40) The interval between the C2H6 and CO2 retention times is 27 min, which is superior to those of Cu(Qc) (5 min) (22) and MUF-15 (7 min). (39)

   C2H6/C2H4 Separation Mechanism
  </h2>
  <p>
   As mentioned above, the asymmetric unit contains one tetrahedral Co(II) atom without a coordinated solvent molecule and one octahedral Co(II) atom with one coordinated solvent molecule. In an octanuclear Co8(μ3-OH)4 cluster, there are four tetrahedral Co(II) atoms and four octahedral Co(II) atoms. Two pairs of open metal sites are generated for the four six-coordinate Co(II) atoms after desolvation in a Co8(μ3-OH)4 cluster. Careful exploration of the Co8(μ3-OH)4 structure shows that the pairs of exposed metal centers are located in the concave pore walls of the cages with a Co Co separation of 4.21 Å (Figures 1a and S11). Such pore geometry makes the open metal sites inaccessible to the C2H4 molecule with a kinetic diameter of 4.163 Å. Thus, the annihilation of open metal sites in this structure facilitates the C2H6-selective C2H6/C2H4 separation.

   Furthermore, as shown in Figure 1c and d, the walls of the cage in JXNU-9 are made of eight phenyl rings, which provide a π-electron-cloud surrounding environment for accommodating the more polarizable C2H6 molecules and facilitating the close contacts for the large C2H6 molecules. To gain deep insight into the selective gas separation mechanism, first-principles dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT-D) calculations were performed on JXNU-9. van der Waals interactions between the C2H6 molecules and the surrounding π-electron clouds of the host framework were found after loading C2H6 gases. At the preferential binding sites, the static binding energies are -46.3 and -37.3 kJ mol-1 for C2H6 and C2H4, respectively. The calculation results show that the preferred sites for both molecules are located in the small cages. The C2H6 molecule binds to three surrounding phenyl rings with five weak C-H π (H π = 3.11-3.66 Å) interactions (Figure 6). The C2H4 molecule interacts with two phenyl rings through two weak C-H π (H π = 3.13 and 3.16 Å) interactions and one carboxylate oxygen via C-H O (H O = 2.87 Å) hydrogen bonds (Figure 6). As a result, C2H6 molecules form stronger interactions with the host framework through multiple C-H π interactions, in comparison with the less-polarizable C2H4 molecules with fewer C-H π interactions. Such results are consistent with the above experimental observations of the sorption tendency and amounts, as well as the adsorption enthalpy.

   Conclusions
  </h2>
  <p>
   We present a novel cobalt(II) MOF with cages and 1D channels. The formation of the unique octanuclear cobalt oxide clusters in JXNU-9 is unprecedented. JXNU-9 has a superior C2H6 sorption capacity, which outperforms those of most of the C2H6-selective adsorption materials. JXNU-9 exhibits excellent C2H6/C2H4 separation performance as demonstrated by column breakthrough experiments. The formation of multiple C-H π interactions between C2H6 molecules and the phenyl rings of the cages was confirmed by modeling studies. Furthermore, the deactivation of all open metal sites in this structure helps to facilitate the C2H6-selective C2H6/C2H4 separation. Thus, the weakly polar pore surfaces for JXNU-9 and the annihilation of open metal sites in this structure are synergistically responsible for the high C2H6/C2H4 separation performance.
