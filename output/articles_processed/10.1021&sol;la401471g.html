   Abstract

  <p>
   High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideTwo types of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been synthesized and evaluated in the separation of C2 and C3 olefins and paraffins. Whereas Co2(dhtp) ( = Co-CPO-27 = Co-MOF-74) and Mg2(dhtp) show an adsorption selectivity for the olefins ethene and propene over the paraffins ethane and propane, the zeolitic imidazolate framework ZIF-8 behaves in the opposite way and preferentially adsorbs the alkane. Consequently, in breakthrough experiments, the olefins or paraffins, respectively, can be separated.

  <h2>
   1 Introduction
  </h2>
  <p>
   The separation of the C2 to C4 paraffin/olefin mixtures by cryogenic distillation is one of today's indispensable and most energy-intensive processes in the refinery industry. It is, therefore, highly desired to substitute the short chain paraffin/olefin separation by less energy-intensive separation techniques such as adsorption ore membrane permeation.
  </p>
  <p>
   In principle, an adsorptive separation can be accomplished by kinetic or thermodynamic principles. Small differences in the molecular size can cause dramatic changes in the diffusion rates of the mixture components through molecular sieve pores, which lead in their extreme to the molecular sieve effect (size exclusion). Differences in the adsorptive interaction with the adsorbent allow equilibrium-based separations according to different mixed gas adsorption equilibria.
  </p>
  <p>
   A nice example for the kinetic separation of a propane/propene mixture was given by Li et al.. (1) showing that the uptake rate of propene and propane in a series of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) can be controlled by the linker size. On ZIF-8, the slightly smaller propene shows a diffusion coefficient which is about 125 times higher than that one of propane (at 30 °C). The adsorption and diffusion of ethene/ethane mixtures in ZIF-8 was explored by 1H and 13C MAS NMR spectroscopy and by the combination of pulsed field gradient NMR with magic-angle spinning (MAS PFG NMR). The diffusion selectivity was determined to be Dethene:Dethane = 5.5 at a loading of four molecules per cavity. (2) However, the practical exploitation of the different diffusion rates/or the molecular sieve effect seems to be complicated for metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) because of their nonconstant pore size. Framework flexibility can be understood as thermal vibrations of the MOF window, which open the pores for larger molecules. (3) The gate opening effect also causes a larger pore size and is initiated by the linker distortion. (4) From pioneering in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies, it is known that the methyl imidazolate linkers of ZIF-8 show a swing effect upon gas adsorption; thus the pores open and give access to the cavity. (5) Gücüyener et al. explain the preferred adsorption of ethane in comparison to the only slightly lighter and stiffer ethylene on ZIF-7 also by a gate opening mechanism. (6)
  </p>
  <p>
   Several reports have shown that the framework structure of ZIF-8 is in fact more flexible rather than static. Although the size of the pore window of ZIF-8 is estimated from crystallographic data to be 0.34 nm, Sanchez and co-workers adsorbed n-heptane in ZIF-8; (7) Luebbers et al. demonstrated that n-alkanes with a critical diameter of 0.43 nm are easily adsorbed by ZIF-8. (8) In addition, another chromatographic study showed that more bulky branched alkanes (critical diameter > 0.54 nm) are not able to pass the narrow pore windows of ZIF-8, whereas the linear ones are adsorbed. (9) However, in a recent study by Ferreira et al.. it was shown that ZIF-8 can adsorb 2,3-dimethylbutane, with a kinetic diameter of 0.58 nm, but not 2,2-dimethylbutane. (10)
  </p>
  <p>
   The consideration of framework flexibility is crucial to predicting correct separations on MOF membranes. Permeation studies on ZIF-7, (11) ZIF-8, (12) ZIF-22, (13) and ZIF-90 (14) membranes also showed that methane with a critical diameter of 0.38 nm can easily pass the ZIF-8 pore window (0.34 nm), and no sharp cutoff exists for hydrocarbons with critical diameters larger than the crystallographic pore size. In recent papers it is shown that also aromatics such as p-xylene (15) and benzene (16) are adsorbed in ZIF-8, however, most probably by linker distortion rather than by framework flexibility which is engendered by a shift of the coordination points.
  </p>
  <p>
   Different from MOFs, zeolites show a more rigid framework with a clear cutoff. Therefore, adsorptive separation of ethylene/ethane mixtures using the molecular sieve effect is possible on zeolites. Zhu et al. found for SiO2-DD3R that only propylene (critical diameter 0.43 nm) is adsorbed by DD3R with a pore size of 0.45 nm, but propane (0.45 nm) is excluded from the pores. (17) Breakthrough experiments confirm that DD3R is a very effective molecular sieve for the separation of propylene/propane mixtures. (18) Similar results were obtained by Calero et al. (19) for ITQ-12, which is a pure silica zeolite with eight-ring pores (0.39 × 0.42 nm and 0.24 × 0.54 nm). Krishna and van Baten propose different eight-membered-ring zeolite and MOF structures with pore sizes between 0.34 and 0.46 nm as suitable candidates for the separation of propene/propane mixtures by molecular sieving. (20)
  </p>
  <p>
   Another concept for the olefin/paraffin separation is the use of thermodynamic control, i.e.. of specific adsorbate-adsorbent interactions. Whereas polar, cation-containing zeolites such as 13X show a preference for alkene adsorption, (21, 22) nonpolar cation-free zeolites prefer alkane adsorption. (23-25) This preferred alkane over alkene adsorption has been predicted by molecular dynamics calculation of the mixed gas isotherm. Keil et al. predicted a by a factor of 2 stronger ethane than ethene adsorption from an equimolar mixture on carbon nanotubes, (26) but only a slightly stronger ethane than ethene adsorption on silicalite-1. (27)
  </p>
  <p>
   If the metal component of an MOF structure is freely accessible and coordinatively unsaturated, the olefin becomes enriched due to an adsorption via π-complexation. Early examples are the preferred olefin adsorption on Cu3(BTC)2 (28-30) and Ag2[Cr3O(OOCC2H5)6(H2O)3]2. (31) These experimental findings of a preferred olefin adsorption are in accordance with theoretical results showing that ethene is by a factor of 2 more strongly adsorbed on Cu3(BTC)2 than ethane is. (32) During the past year, a steadily growing number of experiments featuring a series of M-MOF-74, also denoted as M-CPO-27 or more generally M2(dhtp) (M = coordinating metal, mostly Co, Ni, Zn, Fe, Mg; dhtp = dihydroxyterephthalate), have been performed. M2(dhtp) is a three-dimensional framework with a honeycomb topology, containing one-dimensional channels (Figure 1, top). In its activated state, the metal center is coordinated in distorted square pyramidal fashion by five oxygen atoms, which are part of the organic linker. With a suitable solvent molecule a sixth metal-oxygen bond is formed resulting in a distorted octahedral coordination. The average cross-sectional channel dimensions are ca. 1.1 nm × 1.1 nm. (33) This adsorbent showed a remarkable and promising olefin/paraffin selectivity as a consequence of the one-dimensional hexagonal channels lined with a high concentration of open metal sites (i.e.. ~4.5 sites/nm3 for Mg2(dhtp). (34)
  </p>
  <p>
   ZIF-8 crystallizes in the sodalite topology, in which every Zn center is coordinated to four nitrogen atoms, forming a tetrahedron (Figure 1, bottom). This leads to six-membered-ring pores with a diameter of 0.34 nm for the pore opening and a total pore diameter of 1.2 nm. (35)
  </p>
  <p>
   It is the aim of this study to prepare two adsorbents with differing olefin/paraffin selectivity. Co2(dhtp) as well as Mg2(dhtp) in comparison to ZIF-8 will be evaluated as adsorbents in fixed-bed adsorbers, by studying the breakthrough behavior of ethane/ethane and propene/propane mixtures. Particular attention will be paid to the stability of the M2(dhtp) structure, which is expected to have a profound effect on the adsorption properties. Theoretical studies hinted at the large potential of Co2(dhtp), reporting high (theoretical) separation factors (highest ever reported for MOFs so far) (36) and remarkable ethene/ethane and propene/propane selectivities for the isostructural Fe2(dhtp). (37) However, M2(dhtp) appears to be sensitive against water, resulting in partial structure degradation. (38)

   2 Experimental Section
  </h2>
  <h2>
   2.1 Solvothermal Synthesis of the MOFs under Study
  </h2>
  <p>
   Unless otherwise noted, all procedures were performed under ambient atmosphere and temperature. All reagents were obtained from commercial vendors at reagent grade purity or higher and used without further purification.
  </p>
  <h2>
   2.1.1 Co2(dhtp)
  </h2>
  <p>
   The Co2(dhtp) material studied in this work was synthesized according to the reported (39) procedure with minor modifications. A solution of cobalt acetate tetrahydrate (1.229 g, 4.9 mmol) in water (16 mL) was placed in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave with a volume of 23 mL. Dihydroxyterephthalic acid (0.494 g, 3 mmol) was added. The autoclave was sealed and heated at 110 °C for 72 h. After the reaction the resulting brown mixture was filtrated and the filter cake washed with ca. 200 mL of water. The obtained orange solid was solvent exchanged with ethanol in a Soxhlet apparatus for 24 h. The purified product was activated at 150 °C for 16 h in a vacuum. After the activation Co2(dhtp) was sensitive to moisture and was, therefore, stored under dry argon.
  </p>
  <h2>
   2.1.2 Mg2(dhtp)
  </h2>
  <p>
   Mg2(dhtp) was prepared in a way similar to that described above for Co2(dhtp). Magnesium acetate tetrahydrate (5.860 g, 27 mmol) was dissolved in a mixture of N-methylpyrrolidone (78 mL) and water (12 mL), and dihydroxyterephthalic acid (2.745 g, 14 mmol) was added. The reaction was carried out in a Teflon-lined 125 mL stainless steel autoclave at 120 °C for 24 h. After filtration and solvent exchange the obtained yellow powder was activated at 230 °C in a vacuum for 24 h. Like the cobalt-containing MOF, Mg2(dhtp) is sensitive to moisture. Thus Mg2(dhtp) was stored under argon atmosphere as well.
  </p>
  <h2>
   2.1.3 ZIF-8
  </h2>
  <p>
   For a typical ZIF-8 synthesis, a solution of Zn(NO3)2 6H2O (zinc nitrate hexahydrate, 1 g, 3.36 × 10-3 mol) and HMeIM (2-methylimidazole, 0.552 g, 6.72 × 10-3 mol) in DMF (dimethylformamide, 25 mL) was prepared similar to the procedure reported in ref 35. The synthesis was conducted at 140 °C for 24 h under stirring in a round-bottom flask with reflux condenser. A white powder of crystals with diameters around 10 μm was separated from the solution. The product was Soxhlet-extracted for 48 h with methanol, dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven for 12 h, and pelletized without binder using a hand-operated mechanical press. The pellets were crushed and sieved. Only particles with diameters between 305 and 250 μm were used in the fixed-bed adsorber in order to avoid a large pressure drop.
  </p>
  <p>
   The structure and porosity of the adsorbents were determined by powder X-ray diffraction using a PANalytical X'Pert diffractometer (Cu Kα (λ = 1.54 Å)) and nitrogen adsorption measurements (Quantachrome Autosorb 1 at 77 K, respectively). The specific surface area of the samples was calculated employing the BET method. The BET model has been applied in the range p/p0 = 0.00004-0.015. The in situ X-ray diffraction experiments were carried out using an Anton Paar XRK-900 reaction cell at 40.1 °C and 50% relative humidity.
  </p>
  <h2>
   2.2 Adsorption and Breakthrough Experiments
  </h2>
  <p>
   The single component adsorption isotherms of ethane, ethene, propane, and propene on M2(dhtp) and ZIF-8 were recorded at different temperatures with a modified Micromeritics ASAP 2010 volumetric adsorption apparatus using the powder samples. All samples were outgassed at 100 °C prior to the measurements under vacuum (10-4 hPa). The breakthrough curves were determined in a home-built fixed-bed flow-type apparatus. The separation column was packed with Mg2(dhtp) (m = 0.41 g), Co2(dhtp) (m = 0.75 g), or ZIF-8 (m = 0.54 g). To prevent a high pressure drop, the ZIF-8 powder was carefully pelletized, crushed, and sieved to obtain particles with diameters between 250 and 305 μm. The M2(dhtp) adsorbents were used as obtained during the synthesis due to their instability toward exposure to air and water (vide infra). Due to their relatively large particle size (up to 100 μm), the resulting pressure drop was still acceptable.
  </p>
  <p>
   Thereafter, the samples were in situ activated in the adsorber at 100 °C in flowing helium for 24 h. The feed gas was an equimolar mixture of ethane/ethene and propane/propene with a flow rate of 0.25 mL/min each. The gases are assumed to behave ideally under the prevailing experimental conditions. The dead volume is calculated from the volume of the void space of the packing and the peripheral volume. Therefore, the bulk density of the packing, the real density of the MOFs, and the geometrical dimensions of the apparatus are required. From the dead volume the dead time was calculated.
  </p>
  <p>
   The gas at the outlet of the fixed-bed adsorber was analyzed online by gas chromatography employing a Rt-Alumina Bond CFC (30 m × 0.53 mm × 10 μm) column using a flame ionization detector (FID).

   3 Results and Discussion

   3.1 Solvothermal Synthesis of the MOFs under Study
  </h2>
  <h2>
   3.1.1 M2(dhtp)
  </h2>
  <p>
   Figure 2 shows the powder X-ray diffraction patterns of the Mg2(dhtp)and Co2(dhtp) powders used for determination of the adsorption isotherms and in the breakthrough adsorption experiments. The XRD patterns of the M2(dhtp) samples after activation are shown in comparison to the theoretical pattern (Figure 2). From the comparison of the XRD data with the pattern reported by Dietzel et al.. (33) it is concluded that our sample is a pure M2(dhtp) phase without any crystalline impurities. The specific BET surface area (Figure 2) was determined to 763 and 1420 m2/g for the Co form and the Mg form, respectively, which is in agreement with the literature (Table 1). The reported surface area of M2(dhtp) materials varies largely depending on the metal employed, the synthesis route, and the activation procedure. (40) Part of the lower specific surface area reported for the Co form with respect to the Mg form is due to the lower molecular mass of magnesium (24.3 g/mol) compared to cobalt (58.9 g/mol). It is expected, however, that the accessible surface area and pore volume will largely influence the adsorption and separation properties of the structure under study.

   3.1.2 ZIF-8
  </h2>
  <p>
   The powder XRD pattern of ZIF-8 is shown in Figure 3 (left). The diffractogram confirms the sodalite structure of our ZIF-8 obtained in a modified synthesis in comparison with the original recipe. (35) The experimental XRD powder pattern is in good agreement with the simulated one, confirming the successful synthesis of this material. The specific BET surface area amounts to 1844 m2/g, which is in the range of typical literature values. (10, 32)
  </p>
  <h2>
   3.2 Adsorption of Pure Paraffins and Olefins
  </h2>
  <p>
   Figure 4 shows the adsorption isotherms of ethane, ethene, propane, and propene as single gases on our two sorbents Mg2(dhtp) and Co2(dhtp). Because of the coincidence of the adsorption and desorption isotherms, only the adsorption data points are plotted. Both ethene and propene are adsorbed to a higher extent than the corresponding alkanes ethane and propane. Thus, our expectations were fulfilled: both materials with CPO-27/MOF-74 structure are olefin-selective because of the strong π-complexation between the open Co2+ and Mg2+ sites and the olefin molecules. Surprisingly, the difference in the amount adsorbed for propane and propene on the one hand and ethane and ethene on the other hand is larger for the C3 hydrocarbons than for C2. This experimental finding is in principle in agreement with the paper of Hupp, Snurr, and co-workers. (36) However, in ref 36 the total amounts adsorbed on Co2(dhtp) are somewhat higher than in our study for both C2 and C3. This is certainly a consequence of the lower specific surface area found for our sample. In principle, it can be expected that olefin molecules can be adsorbed up to one per open metal site, resulting in a loading of ca. 6 mmol/g as reported by Bae et al. (36) In contrast, for Mg2(dhtp) a significantly higher adsorption capacity of up to 7.8 mmol/g for propene and 6.9 mmol/g for ethene are found in this study, which is somewhat higher than the literature data. (36) The saturation loading clearly depends on the accessible pore volume, which should be similar for all M2(dhtp) adsorbents regardless of the nature of the metal center, and, thus, depends mainly on the sample quality and stability, which, however, might be different.
  </p>
  <p>
   Further, the complete overlap of adsorption and desorption isotherms confirms that the sorption process is completely reversible at room temperature. In contrast to Co2(dhtp) and Mg2(dhtp), ZIF-8 shows a preference for the hydrocarbon with the higher molecular weight, i.e.. ethane and propane in comparison with ethene and propene. Our finding of a preferred ethane adsorption on ZIF-8 in comparison with ethene is in complete accordance with sorption uptake/desorption experiments on large ZIF-8 crystals with IR detection and grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations. (41, 42) The fact that the paraffin is slightly better adsorbed than the corresponding olefin is characteristic of sorbents without specific interactions such as cation-free nonpolar frameworks. (24, 25, 43) In ref 44 also a preferred ethane adsorption compared with ethene was observed on ZIF-7 and explained by a gate opening mechanism. The adsorption isotherms of propene and propane (Figure 5) on ZIF-8 are very similar and in excellent agreement with a very recent account by Zhang et al.. (45) but significantly higher than the loadings reported in ref 41, which amount to 2.82 and 2.62 mmol/g for propylene and propane, respectively, at 30 °C.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the pressure range studied, saturation is not reached and the uptake of the C3 hydrocarbons is by a factor of ca. 2 higher compared to the significantly smaller hydrocarbons ethane and ethene. Moreover, the ethene and ethane isotherms are almost linear and show Henry-type behavior. The temperature dependent Henry constants are summarized in Table 2. An equilibrium selectivity α2 = K1/K2 = 1.85 is calculated at 20 °C from the Henry constants K1 and K2 of the respective adsorption isotherms. The amount of ethene and ethane adsorbed decreases with increasing temperature (Figure 6), although the preferential adsorption of the alkane with respect to the olefin does not change with temperature.

  <p>
   In the case of C3 hydrocarbons, the adsorption selectivity is small since the two isotherms almost coincide. From the literature (45) it is known that the amount of n-butane and n-butene is slightly slower than that of propane and propene, respectively, but the isotherms show an even stronger Langmuir-type behavior than the C3 hydrocarbons. Thus, it appears that the interaction strength increases in the order C2 < C3 < C4. Whether the often suggested gate opening mechanism (6, 45) does play a role in small hydrocarbon adsorption in ZIF-8 is at the moment questionable.

   3.3 Breakthrough Curves in a Fixed-Bed Adsorber
  </h2>
  <p>
   Breakthrough curves of equimolar mixtures of ethane/ethene and propane/propene have been measured in a fixed bed adsorbed at 22 °C (Figure 7). For both Co2(dhtp) and Mg2(dhtp), characteristically shaped breakthrough curves are observed. When starting from a clean adsorber, initially both the olefin and the paraffin are completely removed from the feed stream, before the alkane breaks through first. The weaker bound compound gets displaced by the stronger adsorbed one, which leads to the overshoot above the relative concentration c/c0 = 1 (with c0 = feed concentration). Similar results have been observed for the separation of C3 (46) and iso-C4 (28) hydrocarbons over Cu3(BTC)2 (HKUST-1). This confirms that the paraffin is displaced by the stronger adsorbed olefin. Thus, in complete accordance with the expectations from the adsorption isotherms, Co2(dhtp) and Mg2(dhtp) turned out to be olefin-selective.

   In contrast to the single component isotherms, Co2(dhtp) shows a higher adsorption capacity than Mg2(dhtp) when normalized to the applied adsorbent mass. The breakthrough curves of Co2(dhtp) and Mg2(dhtp) show clear olefin preference because of the π-interaction of the accessible M2+ site with the olefin molecules. Therefore, the olefin is completely separated from the paraffin on Co2(dhtp) and Mg2(dhtp).

   From the breakthrough curves of the olefin/paraffin mixtures, separation factors can be derived. (47) Frontal analysis, viz.. integration of the areas in the breakthrough curves, results in separation factors α = q(ethene)/q(ethane) = 1.7 and α = q(propene)/q(propane) = 2.9 for Co2(dhtp). The separation factors derived for Mg2(dhtp) are even lower and amount to 1.4 and 1.7 for ethene/ethane and propene/propane, respectively. These factors are much lower than those reported by Hupp, Snurr, and co-workers derived from mixed gas IAST isotherms calculated from ethane, ethene, propane, and propene single component isotherms. For example, a value of 46 for the (theoretical) propene/propane adsorption selectivity is calculated for Co2(dhtp). (36) However, in the above-discussed paper, no separation factors are derived from the experimental displacement experiments described. (36) Furthermore, it has to be pointed out that an equimolar mixture of olefin and paraffin with partial pressures of 500 hPa is used in our experiments. Typically, the separation factors increase significantly when more diluted gas streams are employed. (36, 48)

   While very high separation factors are calculated from single component isotherms, we derive from our breakthrough experiements only values around 2-3. The reasons for this discrepancy are at present not clear. There could be differences in the quality of the Co2(dhtp) which result in a lower adsorption capacity of our sample, but the XRD and the nitrogen sorption isotherms of our Co2(dhtp) are similar to those reported in refs 36 and 40. Another reason could be different sample activations or even different ways to calculate/determine the adsorption selectivities. Partial destruction of the structure by pelletization and water adsorption also must be considered. Therefore, powder X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded in a controlled N2/water atmosphere at room temperature. After keeping the samples in dry nitrogen for 5 h, a stream of water in nitrogen (50% relative humidity (RH)) was passed over the sample for an additional 50 h before switching back to dry nitrogen (Figure 8). For Mg2(dhtp) and Co2(dhtp), a clear decrease in intensity is observed for the (110) and (300) reflections (Figure 9). The decrease in intensity of the XRD reflections is accompanied by a strong decrease in the specific ABET surface area (from 1420 to <200 m2/g) in the case of Mg2(dhtp) within a few minutes. When the sample is again flushed with dry nitrogen, the intensity of the XRD reflections does not change. The specific surface also does not rise again. This behavior was unexpected since the M2(dhtp) structure is generally considered to be stable against water and even water adsorption isotherms are reported in the literature. (40) The situation is somewhat different for Co2(dhtp). While the intensity of the (110) and the (300) reflections is also declining after exposure to water, the decrease in surface area is relatively small (ca. 200 m2/g). Moreover, the intensity of those reflections rises again after flushing the sample with dry nitrogen. It is, thus, obvious that both materials are sensitive to water adsorption, which potentially blocks the CUS sites with concomitant decrease in separation potential or partial irreversible structure destruction or change. A possible formation of Mg(OH)2 nanocrystals on the outside of the Mg2(dhtp) may block access to the channel system. A detailed 25 Mg NMR study currently underway might help to elucidate this point.

   For ZIF-8, a different separation behavior is observed. ZIF-8 appears to be paraffin-selective, and consequently, here first the olefins ethene and propene are detected at the adsorber outlet (Figure 7). It is noted again that the concentration of the olefins at the adsorber outlet exceeds the feed concentration. This overshoot, the so-called roll-up behavior, is due to displacement of the weaker adsorbed olefin by the stronger adsorbed paraffin. The resulting desorption of the olefin results in a further increase of the concentration at the adsorber outlet. The analysis of the breakthrough curves of ZIF-8 shows a clear paraffin preference and gives the separation factors α = q(ethene)/q(ethane) = 0.48 and α = q(propene)/q(propane) = 0.7. In agreement with the single component isotherms, the uptakes of the C3 hydrocarbons are significantly higher than those of the C2 hydrocarbons. Nevertheless, the separations of the propane/propene and the ethane/ethene mixture are nearly the same, which does not fit the different equilibrium selectivities found by the adsorption measurements. The ratio of the diffusion coefficients for propene/propane is about 125, (1) which is 25 times higher than the ratio measured for Dethene/Dethane by Chmelik et al. (2) Thus, the breakthrough curves also reflect the very large difference in diffusivities of propene and propane. Because of the interesting separation potential observed in the breakthrough curves of olefin-paraffin mixtures on ZIF-8, single component adsorption isotherms (Figure 6) and breakthrough curves were recorded at different temperatures (Figure 10). The shape of the breakthrough curves changes with decreasing temperature, showing a more pronounced displacement of the olefin at lower temperature. The separation factor also increases with decreasing temperature to ca. 0.25 while maintaining the alkane preference.

   Very high separation factors for propene/propane of up to 50 (50) and 40 (51) are reported for supported ZIF-8 membranes. Olson and co-workers (1) reported that propene is much faster adsorbed than the corresponding propane on ZIF-8 at 303 K. From the initial adsorption rates, a ratio for the diffusion coefficients of Dpropylene:Dpropane = 125 was estimated. (1) Thus, for the separation of propene and propane over ZIF-8, a kinetic separation using pressure swing adsorption (PSA) with short cycle times might be feasible. This will probably not work for the significantly smaller C2 hydrocarbons where an equilibrium based separation has to be employed. For industrially relevant separations of steam cracker and fluid catalytic cracking unit effluents, the olefin/paraffin ratio is around 10; viz.. much smaller concentrations of paraffins must be removed from the excess olefins which are used for the production of polyethylene and polypropylene. Here, ZIF-8 is one of the few adsorbents that adsorb the paraffin preferentially, which might be advantageous for an adsorption based separation process.

   4 Conclusions
  </h2>
  <p>
   Breakthrough curves of equimolar mixtures of ethane/ethene and propane/propene have been measured in a fixed-bed adsorber. In complete accordance with the expectations from the single component adsorption isotherms, Co2(dhtp) and Mg2(dhtp) turned out to be olefin-selective. As a result, first the alkanes ethane and propane break through. However, the theoretically predicted separation factors are significantly larger than those found in this study. Moreover, both adsorbents appear to be sensitive to water, which might limit their industrial application. In contrast, ZIF-8 is paraffin-selective, and consequently, here first the olefins ethene and propene are detected at the adsorber outlet. This is of particular importance for the industrial separation of ethane/ethene and propane/propene containing streams, which typically contain the olefin in excess (ratio ~ 10/1) and the target product is a polymer-grade olefin (purity > 99.5%).
