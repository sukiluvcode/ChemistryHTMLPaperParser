   Introduction
  </h2>
  <p>
   Ethylene (C2H4) is indispensable in the petrochemical industry and widely used to produce polyethylene, ethylene oxide, and so on, in which the annual global production is hundreds of million tons, (1) as called industrial blood. (2) There are many methods for the production of C2H4 in the petrochemical industry, such as steam cracking with naphtha and catalytic cracking of light hydrocarbons. The production of C2H4 based on steam cracking of naphtha occupies a large proportion in the petrochemical industry and is still the main method of producing C2H4 up to date, in which the process ineluctably leads into a small amount of C2H6 and C2H2 as impurities, which does not meet C2H4 purity requirements. The existence of C2H6 extends reactor residence time and reduces production per unit time; what's more, C2H6 often leaves the process of polymerization with the emission of gases, posing a potential hazard to human health and safety. The presence of C2H2 in C2H4 raw material will be toxic to the catalysts used in the polymerization process and then notably have a bad impact on the production quality of polyethylene. Moreover, C2H2 reacts with metal catalysts/pipeline to form solid metal acetylides, which can block the fluid and result in explosion. Therefore, the impurities of C2H6 and C2H2 should be purified and the concentration should be reduced to meet the requirements. However, because of their similar physical properties, including very similar molecule size (C2H2: 3.32 × 3.34 × 5.70 Å3, C2H4: 3.28 × 4.18 × 4.84 Å3, C2H6: 4.08 × 3.81 × 4.82 Å3) (3,4) and volatility, the separation of C2H4 from C2 hydrocarbons is considered as one of the most difficult and important processes. (1) Heat-driven cryogenic distillation is still widely used to separate these mixture substances, which is an energy intensive process and takes up immense space. (5,6) In response to a greener, more energy-efficient development, more efforts have been devoted to develop an efficient separation strategy, especially based on a physical adsorption mechanism. Adsorption separation using the porous solid materials is an alternative, such as zeolite, activated carbon, and γ-Al2O3. (7-9) These conventional materials face problems of this kind or that kind. On the one hand, there is poor selectivity owing to the scarcity of specific recognition of molecular properties; on the other hand, the adsorption capacity of these conventional materials is also limited. (10)
  </p>
  <p>
   In recent years, as one kind of emerging porous material, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), also known as porous coordination polymers (PCPs), which consist of metal or metal clusters nodes and ligand linkers exhibit more typical characteristics, such as designable pore sizes and multifunctional surface, that make them show broad application prospects in the realms of gas adsorption and separation, such as C2H4/C2H6, (11-13) C2H2/C2H4, (14,15) C3H6/C3H8, (16-18) and CO2/C2H2. (19,20) So far, a succession of advances have been made through making use of MOFs as adsorbents in the field of binary separation (19-33) and a few ternary separations. (34-37)
  </p>
  <p>
   However, the use of MOFs as adsorbents in the separation of C2 hydrocarbons is suffering from either poor selectivity because of their similar molecule sizes or low uptake amounts due to smaller pore volume. Furthermore, for the C2H6/C2H4 binary mixture separation, it is easier to adsorb ethylene owing to the formation of π-complexation between the unsaturated metal ions and the double bond with ethylene like other conventional materials, so that it still needs a desorption process that increases the energy consumption, and it also brings challenges to the separation and purification of C2H4. For the C2H2/C2H4 mixture, the adsorbents generally have stronger binding affinity with C2H2 due to the difference of polarizability, which facilitates direct purification of C2H4. Considering that the amounts of C2H6 and C2H2 occupy relatively small percentages in the C2H4 raw material, so as long as C2H6 and C2H2 are preferentially adsorbed, it may be possible to achieve the separation of C2H4 from C2 hydrocarbons directly. Nevertheless, to date, the MOFs which act as multifunction adsorbents preferring to simultaneously adsorb C2H6 and C2H2 to achieve purification of ethylene are still very rare. (34,36)
  </p>
  <p>
   Herein, we have exploited such a microporous MOF [Mg2(TCPE)(μ2-OH2)(DMA)2] solvents (NUM-9, H4TCPE = 4,4′,4″,4′′′-(ethene-1,1,2,2-tetrayl) tetrabenzoic acid, DMA = N,N-dimethylacetamide) based on a physical adsorption mechanism with excellent thermal and solvent stabilities for efficient separation of C2H4 from C2 hydrocarbons. Gas adsorption isotherms indicate that NUM-9a preferentially adsorbs C2H6 and C2H2 from C2 hydrocarbon mixtures, and the heat of adsorption also verifies this view. The practical separation potential has been established by IAST selectivities calculations and the breakthrough experiments, and the binding affinity sites for C2 hydrocarbons have been evidenced by Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) calculations. All the results show that NUM-9a has multi-functions, and it can realize the efficient separation of C2H4 from C2 hydrocarbon mixtures so that the purpose of saving energy and green development is achieved.

   Materials and Method
  </h2>
  <p>
   All the chemical reagents and solvents were received from commercial suppliers in high purity and used without further purification. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were performed on a Rigaku standard TG-DTA analyzer from room temperature to 800 °C under an air atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 °C min-1, using an empty and clean Al2O3 crucible as reference. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns were collected on a Rigaku Miniflex 600 at 40 kV and 15 mA with a scan rate of 5.0 deg min-1, using Cu-Kα radiation in an air atmosphere. In situ variable temperature PXRD (VT-PXRD) patterns were collected on a Bruker D8 diffractometer.

  <h2>
   Synthesis of NUM-9 ([Mg2(TCPE)(μ2-OH2)(DMA)2] Solvents)
  </h2>
  <p>
   A mixture of Mg(NO3)2 4H2O (20 mg, 0.1 mmol), H4TCPE (10 mg, 0.01 mmol, H4TCPE = 4,4′,4″,4′′′-(ethene-1,1,2,2-tetrayl) tetrabenzoic acid) was dissolved with DMA (1.5 mL), CH3CH2OH (1 mL), and deionized water (0.3 mL) in a 10 mL screw-capped glass vial, and then the sealed vial was heated to 100 °C for 72 h, which was then cooled to room temperature. The light yellow near rectangular block crystals obtained were washed several times with DMA for single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Yield: 89% based on H4TCPE.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Activation of NUM-9 (NUM-9a)
  </h2>
  <p>
   The fresh sample of NUM-9 was guest exchanged with anhydrous acetone five times, and the solvent-exchange sample was evacuated less than 10-5 Torr at 150 °C for 10 h to obtain the NUM-9a.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Single-Component Gas Adsorption Measurements
  </h2>
  <p>
   The single-component gas adsorption/desorption isotherms of N2, C2H6, C2H4, and C2H2 were measured at different temperatures (77 K for N2; 273, 298, and 313 K for C2H6, C2H4, and C2H2). The N2 adsorption isotherm for pressures within 0-1.0 bar was measured at 77 K with liquid nitrogen using a Micrometrics ASAP 2460 volumetric gas adsorption analyzer. A sample of NUM-9a (about 100 mg) was used for the sorption measurement of C2 hydrocarbons from 273 to 313 K, which was precisely controlled with a LAUDR RP890 recirculating control system containing dry ethanol by a Micrometrics ASAP 2020M volumetric gas adsorption analyzer.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Dynamic Breakthrough Experiment
  </h2>
  <p>
   In the column breakthrough experiment, 0.9040 g of adsorbent (NUM-9) was packed into a customized quartz column (4 mm inner diameter × 100 mm) with quartz wool padding the void space. NUM-9 was in-site activated at 423 K under vacuum to obtain the purity adsorbent and then was purged with He flow at 2 mL min-1. The gas mixtures of C2H6/C2H4 and C2H2/C2H4 flow were also leaded into at 2 mL min-1, and the outlet concentration was monitored with gas chromatography (TCD-Thermal Conductivity Detector, detection limit 0.1%).
  </p>
  <h2>
   Results and Discussion
  </h2>
  <p>
   Single-crystal X-ray diffraction revealed that NUM-9 crystallizes in the orthorhombic system with Cmca space group. The asymmetric unit of NUM-9 contains two crystallographically independent Mg2+, half of a TCPE4- ligand, one bridged water (μ2-OH2), and two coordinated DMA molecules. Two types of Mg2+ exhibit a 6-coordination model, and they are both coordinated with four oxygen atoms from different carboxylate groups of TCPE4-, one oxygen atom from a DMA molecule, and one bridged oxygen atom of μ2-OH2. The two Mg2+ ions are connected by two carboxyl groups and one bridged oxygen atom of μ2-OH2, and two pairs of Mg2+ are linked to each other by four shared carboxyl groups (Figure 1a), forming a tetranuclear magnesium(II) cluster. There are two DMA molecules per pair of two magnesium(II) ions, so the tetranuclear magnesium(II) cluster can be identified as an 8-connected node linked by eight TCPE4- ligands. Furthermore, the Mg2+ clusters are connected to TCPE4- ligands to form a three-dimensional framework with zigzag-shaped square channels, generating one-dimensional approximately square channels with the pore size about 4.5 × 4.5 Å2 along the c axis (Figure 1c). On the basis of the single-crystal X-ray diffraction data, the experimental PXRD pattern of the synthesized NUM-9 is consistent well with the simulated pattern, indicating that the synthesized bulk NUM-9 has high phase purity (Figure S1).
  </p>
  <p>
   Then we explored the stability of NUM-9. The results of VT-PXRD show that the MOF has excellent thermal property sustained to 500 °C (Figure S2). The thermogravimetric curve was carried out under a flowing air atmosphere; as shown in Figure S3, it can be seen that NUM-9 can maintain stability up to approximately 500 °C, which is completely consistent with the result of VT-PXRD. The structure of NUM-9 has slightly changed at about 190 °C and eventually collapsed at 500 °C. Furthermore, we tested the solvent stability of NUM-9 in different solvents (Figures S4 and S5), and this material also exhibits excellent performance. In addition, the crystal characteristic of NUM-9 can still be maintained after the sample activation, which was confirmed by matching its PXRD pattern with the pattern of the as-synthesized sample (Figure S6). Obviously, NUM-9 shows high thermal and solvent stability, which stimulated us to explore the adsorption and separation performance of this material.
  </p>
  <p>
   To investigate the gas adsorption capacity, the first is to confirm the permanent porosity of the material. We prepared the activated NUM-9a by high vacuum at 423 K with the acetone-exchanged sample; then the permanent porosity of NUM-9a was verified by the N2 sorption isotherm at 77 K. As shown in Figure S7, a completely reversible type I isotherm apparently indicates the microporous nature of NUM-9a. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (Langmuir) surface area based on the nitrogen adsorption isotherm is about 330 m2 g-1 (371 m2 g-1) for NUM-9a. The pore size distribution of NUM-9a exported from the nitrogen adsorption isotherm in the light of the Horvath-Kawazoe method shows a pore approximately at 3.6 Å (Figure S8), which is a little lower than that measured from the single crystal structure, owing to the slightly deficient filling of N2 on the fluctuant pore surfaces. It may have some application in gas adsorption and separation inspired by its structure, which is abundant with benzene rings, and may have strong interactions with adsorbed gases. On the basis of the above analysis, we try to explore the adsorption and separation potential of this compound toward C2 hydrocarbons. The single-component equilibrium adsorption isotherms for C2H6, C2H4, and C2H2 were measured first at different temperatures (273, 298, and 313 K). All adsorption isotherms are completely reversible, and the adsorption curves are only shown for the purpose of clarity in Figure 2a-c. Not surprisingly, the uptake amounts of adsorbed gases show a downward trend with the temperature increasing (Figure 2d). The exciting part is that NUM-9a can adsorb higher C2H6 and C2H2 than C2H4 in all the analysis conditions, which implies a C2H6/C2H2-selective performance in NUM-9a. Moreover, as the temperature increases, the difference in the uptake capacity of the adsorbed gases becomes obvious. The uptake of the adsorbed gases is relatively close at 1.0 bar and 273 K (C2H6: 64.05 cm3 g-1, C2H4: 62.22 cm3 g-1, C2H2: 65.52 cm3 g-1; uptake capacity difference ratio is 3% and 5% for C2H6/C2H4 and C2H2/C2H4, respectively), and the difference of uptake amount is conspicuous at 313 K and 1.0 bar (C2H6: 46.19 cm3 g-1, C2H4: 40.04 cm3 g-1, C2H2: 44.46 cm3 g-1; uptake capacity difference ratio is 13% and 11% for C2H6/C2H4 and C2H2/C2H4, respectively). The uptake amount of C2H6 is about 55.55 cm3 g-1 (2.48 mmol g-1) at 298 K and 1.0 bar, higher than that of many famous MOFs, such as ZIF-7 (1.85 mmol g-1) (38) and MAF-49 (1.73 mmol g-1), (11) and lower than that of some excellent MOFs, such as Fe2(O)2(dobdc) (3.32 mmol g-1), (39) TJT-100 (3.84 mmol g-1), (34) MUF-15 (4.69 mmol g-1), (21) and JNU-2 (4.19 mmol g-1). (35) Furthermore, observing the gas adsorption curves, it can also be seen that there may also be better separation performance between C2H4 and C2H2. The obvious difference of adsorption capacity and the characteristic of selective adsorption may achieve the separation of C2H4 from C2 hydrocarbons. Generally, gas adsorption selectivity is associated with adsorption performance in the low-pressure area; then we carefully evaluate the adsorption performance of each gas in the low-pressure area at 273, 298, and 313 K. Near the low-pressure area, the adsorption isotherms of C2H6 and C2H2 are steeper than that of C2H4, indicating the interaction of adsorbents and the framework is stronger; at the same time, we can conclude that NUM-9a has multifunction performance in the separation realms of C2H6/C2H4 and C2H2/C2H4, in which NUM-9a may possess the characteristic of achieving the one-step purification of C2H4 from C2 hydrocarbons.

  <p>
   In order to quantitatively illustrate the binding affinity of NUM-9a toward C2H6, C2H4, and C2H2, the coverage dependent adsorption enthalpies (Qst) of NUM-9a for C2H6, C2H4, and C2H2 were evaluated experimentally from single-component isotherms collected at 273, 298, and 313 K based on the method of a virial equation. As shown in Figure 3, the collected Qst values at zero coverage are 35.75, 32.32, and 35.79 kJ mol-1 for C2H6, C2H4, and C2H2, respectively. The Qst values for C2H6 and C2H2 are somewhat higher than that for C2H4 at zero coverage, which indicates NUM-9 has the relatively stronger affinity for C2H6 and C2H2 than C2H4 with an abnormal phenomenon. Moreover, the calculation result of Qst is consistent with the experimental results.
  </p>
  <p>
   To comprehend the preferential adsorption behavior of C2H6 and C2H2 than C2H4, we carried out GCMC simulation to calculate the energy distribution of C2 hydrocarbons in NUM-9a at 313 K and 1.0 bar. Primarily C-H O and C-H π interactions and open metal sites could be found after loading of C2 hydrocarbon molecules into the skeleton of NUM-9a. As shown in Figure 4, the largest C2H6 molecule and the most complex spatial configuration in C2 hydrocarbons make it have more interactions with the framework, and it can interact with the framework by forming four C-H O (H O 3.399(0)-3.516(3) Å). At the same time, more hydrogens are forming multi C-H π (C-H π 2.905(8)-4.027(2) Å) interactions between an C2H6 molecule and the phenyl rings within the channels. Owing to the existence of open metal sites, both C2H2 and C2H4 may interact with the coordination unsaturated metal ions. However, due to the larger distance of open metal sites and the C2H4 molecule, the interaction could be ignored. The plane configuration of the C2H4 molecule interacts with the framework through three C-H O (H O 2.787(0)-3.497(7) Å) and two C-H π (C-H π 3.537(3)-3.542(5) Å), so the interactions between C2H4 and the framework mainly depend on the C-H O and C-H π. The linear C2H2 molecule with a triple bond has a strong interaction with the coordination unsaturated Mg2+ provided by removing the oxygen atom of the DMA molecule (C≡C Mg 2.796(5)-2.936(3) Å). Moreover, C2H2 molecules interact with the framework through four C-H O (H O 3.004(9)-3.491(8) Å). So the C2H2 molecules show the strongest interactions with the framework, and then the largest C2H6 molecules form the more C-H O and C-H π interactions than that for C2H4. Overall, the calculation results showed the stronger host-guest interactions for C2H2 and C2H6 rather than that of C2H4. In addition, the energy distribution of C2H2 was wider compared with that of C2H6 and C2H4, which indicated two kinds of preferential adsorption sites for C2H2 (Figure S24). Obviously, the results of energy distribution for C2 hydrocarbons were consistent with the trend of adsorption isotherms. The reason for such an adsorption behavior of C2 hydrocarbons can be ascribed to the difference in the interactions of C-H O and C-H π between subject and guests; moreover, the coordination unsaturated metal ions played an important role in these adsorption behaviors.

   NUM-9a has a series of typical characteristics of the high adsorption capacities and strong binding affinity for C2H6 and C2H2; therefore, it has the potential excellent property of purifying C2H4 from the mixtures of C2H6/C2H4 and C2H2/C2H4. So we further evaluated these adsorption selectivities of C2H6/C2H4 (10/90) and C2H2/C2H4 (1/99) for NUM-9a using ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST). As shown in Figure 5, the adsorption selectivity of C2H6/C2H4 at 100 kPa and 298 K is determined to around 1.62 and can reach 1.63 at 100 kPa and 313 K, and the value is around 1.48 for C2H2/C2H4 at 298 and 313 K. By the calculation of IAST, operating the experiment at 313 K is a better condition, in which the adsorption selectivity values of both C2H6/C2H4 and C2H2/C2H4 can reach approximately 1.5. The adsorption selectivity of C2H6/C2H4 (50/50) also was calculated considering that the most of the C2H6-selective MOFs' calculated C2H6/C2H4 binary mixture ratio is 50:50. As shown in Figure S29, the adsorption selectivity of C2H6/C2H4 (50/50) at 100 kPa and 298 K is determined to around 1.61. This value is also higher than that of many famous MOFs reported, such as ZIF-7 (1.5), (38) MIL-142A (1.51), (40) UTSA-33 (1.4), (41) UTSA-35 (1.4), (42) and ZIU-121a (1.51), (43) but lower than that of partial top-performing MOFs, such as Fe2(O2)(dobdc) (4.4) (39) and ZJU-120a (2.74). (43)
  </p>
  <p>
   To further examine the C2H6/C2H4 and C2H2/C2H4 practical separation performance of NUM-9a, breakthrough experiments were carried out where the C2H6/C2H4 mixture concentration ratio of 10/90 (v/v) and the C2H2/C2H4 mixture concentration ratio of 1/99 (v/v) were injected into a packed column of NUM-9a with a rate of 2 mL min-1 at 313 K. As shown in Figure 6a,b, the results of breakthrough experiments show that the NUM-9a is a multifunction material, which can preferentially detect C2H4 in the C2H6/C2H4 and C2H2/C2H4 breakthrough experiment to achieve the purpose of C2H4 purification without more desorption. In terms of total flow and breakthrough time, compared with other C2H6-selective MOFs, such as PCN-245, (10) PCN-250, (44) and MIL-142A, (40)NUM-9a's performance is quite good. And NUM-9a exhibited the separation ability for the C2H6/C2H4 binary mixture comparable to some materials, such as ZJU-120a. (43)NUM-9a not only can selectively adsorb C2H6 but also showed the excellent separation performance for the C2H2/C2H4 mixture. Obviously, C2H6/C2H2-selective MOFs can achieve efficient separation in that C2H4 is obtained directly and simplifies the separation procedure.
  </p>
  <p>
   Accordingly, NUM-9a exhibits not only an C2H6/C2H2-selective behavior but also the outstanding C2H6/C2H4 and C2H2/C2H4 binary mixture separation performances. In light of the unique adsorption behavior, the C2H6/C2H4/C2H2 (9/90/1, v/v/v) ternary mixture, close to an actual separation process, the separation performance with NUM-9a has been evaluated by transient breakthrough simulations, which can be used as a guide for actual industrial implementation potential. As shown in Figure 6c,d, indeed, NUM-9a shows a certain performance of C2H6/C2H4/C2H2 mixture separation, which indicates the adsorbent possesses the capacity of one-step purification of C2H4.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Conclusions
  </h2>
  <p>
   In summary, we report a multifunction microporous Mg-based MOF (NUM-9) with prominent structure stability. The good IAST selectivity values and favorable dynamic column breakthrough experiments exhibit that NUM-9 selectively adsorbs C2H6 and C2H2, showing the characteristic of C2H6/C2H2 selectivity. Due to the interaction difference between the subject and guest, NUM-9a possesses properties of purifying C2H4 from C2 hydrocarbons, which show excellent performances in the separation of C2H6/C2H4, C2H2/C2H4, and C2/C2H4. This work will promote the goal of one-step purification of ethylene, which can meet the requirements of green and energy-efficient sustainable society development. Furthermore, the research will promote the application of MOFs in the separation realms, and more efforts should be given to achieve the greener process of separation and purification.
