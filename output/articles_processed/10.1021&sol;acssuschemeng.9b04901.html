   High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideEffective utilization of Ag(I) π-complexation adsorbents for practical C2H4/C2H6 separation urges both good separating performances and high stabilities. In this work, we incorporated AgNO3 onto a typical metal-organic framework (MOF) of MIL-101 to obtain efficient Ag(I) π-complexation adsorbents. It was found that the separation performances were highly dependent on the location of the AgNO3, which could be at the interior or the exterior of nanoporous MIL-101. Confining AgNO3 inside the nanopores of MIL-101 was achieved through employing a double-solvent approach. The resulting AgM-DS adsorbents exhibited superior performances compared with not only pristine MIL-101 but also other modified samples with AgNO3 at the exterior of MIL-101. To be specific, the optimal 1.6AgM-DS adsorbent secured good C2H4/C2H6 separation, which is C2H4 uptake (75.5 cm3 g-1) and C2H4/C2H6 selectivity (9.5) at 100 kPa. For comparison, the C2H4 uptakes for MIL-101, 1.6AgM-WI, and 1.6AgM-SG were merely 48.1, 56.0, and 19.4 cm3 g-1, and the corresponding IAST selectivity was only 1.1, 8.1, and 1.8, respectively. It was further indicated that the 1.6AgM-DS adsorbent maintained good stability for 3 weeks, alleviating the light sensitivity of AgNO3. This work opens an avenue for constructing stable Ag(I) sites on MOFs to develop π-complexation adsorbents.

  <h2>
   Introduction
  </h2>
  <p>
   Ethylene (C2H4) is an important feedstock for producing various chemicals, for example, polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, alcohol, vinylbenzene, epoxyethane, and acetaldehyde. (1-3) In the chemical industries, C2H4 is mainly derived from steam cracking but always has other short-chain hydrocarbons as impurities. (4-6) Distillation is efficient for separation of short-chain hydrocarbons with distinct carbon numbers and then leads to the generation of ethylene/ethane (C2H4/C2H6) mixtures. Further capture of C2H4 from C2H4/C2H6 mixtures is not easy to achieve because of the immensely close molecular sizes and volatilities of C2H4 and C2H6. Currently, effective C2H4/C2H6 separation predominantly relies on cryogenic distillation, which is operated at an ultralow temperature of 183-258 K as well as an ultrahigh pressure of 7-28 bar. In addition, over 100 distillation column trays are required; so, it has been described as one of the most energy-consuming processes. (7-11) The π-complexation adsorption is expected to be a promising alternative to cryogenic distillation. (12-14) The active Cu(I) or Ag(I) sites on the adsorbents can spontaneously form π-complexation interactions with the C═C bonds in C2H4 molecules without any harsh requirements. Compared with van der Waals' forces, the bond strength of π-complexation interactions is much stronger. Based on the distinctions between their bond strength with adsorbents, capturing C2H4 from C2H4/C2H6 mixtures by π-complexation adsorption can be conducted in mild conditions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Decoration of Cu(I) or Ag(I) sites on porous supports is a popular and effective strategy for fabrication of π-complexation adsorbents. (15-17) Various porous materials, for instance, zeolites, (18-20) silica oxides, (21-23) carbons, (24-26) and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), (27-29) have been widely employed as the supports of the π-complexation adsorbents. In particular, MOFs are attracting considerable attention as π-complexation adsorbents because of their enormous surface areas and porous structures for loading active sites. (30-33) However, Cu(I) or Ag(I) site-modified MOFs as the adsorbents are still unable to satisfy the demands of practical applications although they possess great advances comparing with conventional adsorbents. (34) For instance, Ag(I) π-complexation adsorbents have two crucial issues. The first issue is incompetent adsorption performances, including both capacity and selectivity. Because of the natural tendency of aggregation of metal species, Ag(I) sites are favorable to be located at the exterior of the nanopores of MOFs. That is to say, despite Ag(I) sites being incorporated onto the MOFs possessing large surface areas, the good dispersion of Ag(I) sites is not taken for granted. The location of the metal sites on MOFs has a direct association with their dispersion status, and only well-dispersed Ag(I) sites can offer the guarantee of satisfying adsorption performances. As the case stands, there have been very limited investigations on how to confine the Ag(I) sites at the interior of MOFs thus far. The second issue is the stability of the Ag(I) sites. It is well established that some Ag(I) species, like AgNO3, are easy to decompose and form Ag(0) under light irradiation. As a result, the adsorbents show poor stability in C2H4/C2H6 separation because of the decreasing active Ag(I) sites to form π-complexation bonds. Hence, it is highly desirable to control the location and to stabilize Ag(I) sites on MOFs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Herein, we confine Ag(I) sites into the nanopores of a typical MOF of MIL-101 by employing a promising strategy of double-solvent (DS). In this strategy, two solvents are used: one is hydrophilic water for dissolving AgNO3 to form a solution, and another is the hydrophobic n-hexane for heterogeneously dispersing MIL-101 to give rise to a suspension. It is important to highlight that the volume of the AgNO3 solution should be slightly smaller than the pore volume of MIL-101. Therefore, after dropwise adding the AgNO3 solution into the MIL-101/n-hexane suspension, all the AgNO3 solution can be adsorbed inside the hydrophilic nanopores of MIL-101 through the capillary forces. The location of the Ag(I) sites is thereupon inside the nanopores of MIL-101 (Scheme 1). Contributing to the confinement of the nanopores of MIL-101, the aggregation of the Ag(I) sites can be avoided. The resulting Ag(I) π-complexation adsorbent of 1.6AgM-DS shows better performances in both C2H4 capacity and C2H4/C2H6 selectivity than other samples, including MIL-101, 1.6AgM-WI, and 1.6AgM-SG. It is further demonstrated that AgNO3 inside MIL-101 shows a high stability for 3 weeks under natural light irradiation.

   Synthesis of AgNO3-Modified MIL-101
  </h2>
  <h2>
   MIL-101
  </h2>
  <p>
   MIL-101(Cr) was prepared based on a typical route. (35,36) First, Cr(NO3)3 9H2O (2.0007 g), TPA (0.8307 g), and ultrapure water (25.2 mL) were mixed and stirred for 1 h. Then, HF (0.8 mL) was added into the mixture. Additional 2 h of stirring was conducted; after that, the mixture was loaded into a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and followed by being treated at 220 °C for 8 h. Then, the product was gradually cooled down to 25 °C, filtrated, and dried at 150 °C. The obtained as-prepared powder was then immersed in DMF with refluxing at 150 °C for 24 h with the dosage of 50 mL per gram of the powder, and dried at 100 °C for over 1 h. For the purpose of eliminating DMF, the product was purified with ethanol at 60 °C with refluxing for 24 h. At last, the synthesized MIL-101 was dried at 100 °C for over 1 h. Before the use, MIL-101 needed to be activated under vacuum at 150 °C until the adsorbed water and gas were removed.
  </p>
  <h2>
   xAgM-DS
  </h2>
  <p>
   xAgM-DS was prepared by a promising DS method with some refinements. (37,38) First, 0.1 g of MIL-101 was dispersed in 20 mL of hydrophobic n-hexane to generate a suspension followed by sonicating for 15 min and stirring for 2 h. Then, 140 μL of AgNO3 solution was added with a uniform speed in 15 min under vigorous stirring. The suspension was additionally stirred for 2 h, filtrated, and evacuated at 40 °C until dry. Finally, the green powder was transferred into a tube furnace and treated in flowing Ar at 105 °C for 12 h. The obtained sample was marked as xAgM-DS, where x expressed the mass ratio of AgNO3 to MIL-101.
  </p>
  <h2>
   mAgM-WI
  </h2>
  <p>
   mAgM-WI was prepared by a classical wet-impregnation approach. AgNO3 and MIL-101 were simultaneously added into 10 mL of ultrapure water. After stirring for 2 h, the water was completely evaporated through heating at 50 °C. Then, the collected powder was transferred into a tube furnace and treated in flowing Ar at 105 °C for 12 h. The obtained sample was marked as mAgM-WI, where m expressed the mass ratio of AgNO3 to MIL-101.
  </p>
  <h2>
   nAgM-SG
  </h2>
  <p>
   nAgM-SG was prepared by a solid-phase grinding method. AgNO3 was thoroughly mixed with MIL-101 by solid-phase grinding at room conditions. Afterwards, the mixed product was transferred into a tube furnace and treated in flowing Ar at 105 °C for 12 h. The obtained sample was marked as nAgM-SG, where n expressed the mass ratio of AgNO3 to MIL-101.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Characterization
  </h2>
  <p>
   X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed on a Bruker D8 ADVANCE with Cu Kα radiation at a scanning rate of 2 °C min-1 in the 2θ range from 2 to 50°. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images, high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) images, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) elemental mapping, and spectra were obtained from FEI Titan G2 80-200 at 300 kV. AgNO3 content in the resulting adsorbents was tested by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) from PerkinElmer Optima 7300DV. Before measurement, the adsorbents were immersed into nitric acid solution with stirring overnight for dissolving total silver ions into the solution. N2 sorption isotherms were recorded at -196 °C by a Belsorp-max analyzer. The pretreatment of the sample was done at 105 °C in vacuum for 12 h. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was collected from Escalab 250Xi (ThermoFisher Scientific) fitted with a standard and monochromatic Al Kα source.
  </p>
  <h2>
   C2H4/C2H6 Sorption Tests and Calculations
  </h2>
  <p>
   The C2H4 and C2H6 adsorption-desorption performances of the adsorbents were investigated using a Belsorp-max instrument at 25 °C. The operating temperature was precisely adjusted through a circulating water bath. C2H4 adsorption at 35 °C was also tested in order to calculate the isosteric heat. Prior to measurement, the adsorbents were degassed at 105 °C for 12 h.
  </p>
  <p>
   The ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) was used for predicting the C2H4/C2H6 selectivity. (39,40) First, the double Langmuir (DL) model was employed to simulate C2H4 and C2H6 adsorption behaviors, and then the fitted parameters were applied in the calculation of IAST selectivity. (41) The C2H4/C2H6 selectivity of S12 is defined by the equation of (x1/x2)/(y1/y2), where x1 and x2 are the adsorption capacities of components 1 and 2 at equilibrium, and y1 and y2 are the molar fractions of components 1 and 2 in gas phases, respectively. More details are included in the Supporting Information. The isosteric heat of adsorption at a given adsorption amount was derived from the classical Clausius-Clapeyron equation. (42)

   Structural Properties of Adsorbents
  </h2>
  <p>
   Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns of MIL-101 and AgNO3-loaded adsorbents. The diffraction peaks of pure MIL-101 are in good agreement with those reported patterns, (43,44) indicating that MIL-101 is well synthesized. After AgNO3 loading, all the samples preserve the featured patterns as MIL-101, illustrating the structural integrity of the support. In addition, the intensities of the MIL-101 peaks on the AgNO3-modified samples are lower than that of pure MIL-101, probably because of the reduced MIL-101 content after the introduction of guest species. Notably, some peaks at 19.6, 21.7, 24.2, 28.3, 29.6, 31.9, 32.7, 35.5, 39.1, and 39.8° appear on the diffraction patterns of 1.6AgM-WI and 1.6AgM-SG, which can be assigned to AgNO3 (JCPDS no. 43-0649). These intense peaks of guest species on 1.6AgM-WI and 1.6AgM-SG illustrate the agglomeration of AgNO3 into particles. Their sizes calculated by the Scherrer formula using the peaks at 19.6° are larger than 60 nm, and they should be on the outer surface of MIL-101. However, for all the AgM-DS samples, no AgNO3 peaks can be detected, suggesting the good dispersion of AgNO3 inside MIL-101 with no aggregation.
  </p>
  <p>
   The internal features of the 1.6AgM-DS sample are examined by HRTEM. The HRTEM images of 1.6AgM-DS are displayed in Figure 2A,B. The octahedral morphology confirms the well-maintained MIL-101 structure after AgNO3 loading. Besides, substantial small dark dots are found to be homogeneously dispersed on MIL-101. HAADF-STEM images in Figure 2C,D also exhibit the well-dispersed small white dots on MIL-101. The aforementioned XRD results show no AgNO3 diffraction peaks on AgM-DS. Along with the XRD results, the successful introduction of guest species into the interior of MIL-101 rather than exterior is strongly indicated. On the corresponding EDX mapping (Figure 2E-I), the present elements in 1.6AgM-DS are found to be C, Cr, Ag, N, and O. The elements of C, Cr, and partial O are probably derived from MIL-101. In other words, although there are no XRD peaks, in view of EDX mapping, AgNO3 species are confirmed to be anchored into MIL-101. The AgNO3 content in the samples can further be confirmed on account of ICP-OES data (Table 1), and the results are in good accordance with the theoretical values. Moreover, the AgNO3 species are observed to be homogeneously dispersed inside the whole MIL-101 structure.

   Figure 3 profiles the N2 sorption isotherms of MIL-101 and AgNO3-modified samples. Pure MIL-101 follows a type-I pattern. Besides, at the relative pressure of about 0.1 and 0.2, there are secondary uptakes. This is in accordance with the accurate structure of MIL-101 with two kinds of nanopores. The BET surface area of MIL-101 is 2756 m2 g-1 (Table 1). Besides, the total pore volume is 1.626 cm3 g-1; both of them are essentially in agreement with the reported values. (45,46) It is discovered that the N2 adsorption amounts of the samples containing AgNO3 are much lower than that of pure MIL-101, and the adsorption amount of MIL-101 after the double-solvent process (MIL-101-DS) is only slightly inferior to the fresh MIL-101. This gives one more evidence of the decoration of the guest onto the samples, particularly in AgM-DS with no AgNO3 signals on the XRD patterns. In addition, the adsorption amounts, surface areas, and pore volumes increasingly decline with the growing number of AgNO3 species in AgM-DS, illustrating the occupation of nanopores of MIL-101 by AgNO3. It should be pointed out that the 1.6AgM-DS sample displays a larger surface area (846 m2 g-1) and pore volume (0.505 cm3 g-1) compared with the counterpart samples of 1.6AgM-WI (673 m2 g-1, 0.482 cm3 g-1) and 1.6AgM-SG (255 m2 g-1, 0.206 cm3 g-1). This might be resulted from the good AgNO3 dispersion inside MIL-101 in 1.6AgM-DS, as compared to the agglomeration of AgNO3 on the outer surface of MIL-101 in 1.6AgM-WI and 1.6AgM-SG.
  </p>
  <p>
   With the overall consideration of the XRD, TEM, and N2 sorption results, it is rational to conclude that the framework of MIL-101 support is not destroyed after the AgNO3 modification. Moreover, the location of the guest AgNO3 can be controlled by changing the synthesis methods. As to 1.6AgM-WI synthesized by the wet-impregnation method and 1.6AgM-SG derived from the solid-phase grinding approach, AgNO3 species are found to aggregate at the exterior of MIL-101, suggesting poor dispersion. Notably, for the AgM-DS samples prepared by the DS method, AgNO3 species are located at the interior of MIL-101. Owing to the confinement of the nanopores of MIL-101, AgNO3 possesses good dispersion in AgM-DS. In the DS process, two solvents of water and n-hexane are used. The volume of AgNO3 water solution (140 μL) is dramatically lesser than hydrophobic n-hexane (20 mL), and even slightly smaller than the pore volume of MIL-101 (162.6 μL for 0.1 g). Therefore, the small amount of AgNO3 water solution can be driven into the hydrophilic nanopores of MIL-101 by the capillary force. This gives rise to good dispersion of AgNO3 inside MIL-101. In the traditional wet-impregnation method, 10 mL of AgNO3 water solution is used. With only a single solvent, a considerable number of AgNO3 will be at the exterior of MIL-101 after drying, and form aggregation. As to the solid-phase grinding, bulk AgNO3 is ground into ultrafine powders, but they are still not small enough for being transferred into the nanopores of MIL-101.

   C2H4/C2H6 Sorption and Separation Performances
  </h2>
  <p>
   The obtained MIL-101 and AgNO3-modified adsorbents were applied to C2H4/C2H6 separation. Pure component isotherms were collected at 25 °C to evaluate the effectiveness of diverse adsorbents. As shown in Figure 4, the C2H4 and C2H6 uptakes of MIL-101 are measured to be 48.1 and 45.1 cm3 g-1, respectively. The minor difference of the adsorption capacity between C2H4 and C2H6 indicates the low efficiency of MIL-101 for C2H4/C2H6 separation. For AgM-DS (Figures 4 and S1), the encapsulation of AgNO3 into the nanopores of MIL-101 results in enhanced C2H4 uptakes (62.4-75.5 cm3 g-1) and reduced C2H6 uptakes (32.5-16.6 cm3 g-1). Besides, the C2H4 uptakes are found to gradually increase with larger AgNO3 amounts, and reach a maximum value of 75.5 cm3 g-1 on 1.6AgM-DS. However, further increasing the AgNO3 content as in 2.0AgM-DS, a lower capacity of 64.8 cm3 g-1 is obtained. Another interesting finding is that the C2H4 isotherms of AgM-DS describe the significant raise in the low pressure range. This might be a sign of forming strong π-complexation interactions between C═C in C2H4 and Ag(I) sites in AgM-DS. The delay of the C2H4 desorption on AgM-DS verifies these kinds of strong bonds. To this end, the enhanced C2H4 uptakes on AgM-DS are attributed to the Ag(I) sites inside MIL-101, because they are favorable to form π-complexation bonds with C2H4. Nevertheless, as shown on 2.0AgM-DS, too much AgNO3 gives rise to abating of π-complexation adsorption because of excessive reduction of surface areas of the adsorbents. With regard to pure MIL-101, neither prominent increasing uptake at the low pressure of adsorption nor desorption delay can be observed on C2H4 isotherm, and the isotherm is close to a straight line. These findings imply that the interactions between C2H4 and MIL-101 stand a good chance to be van der Waals' forces. When referring to C2H6 sorption, both MIL-101 and AgM-DS adsorbents demonstrate physical interactions as well. The reduced C2H6 uptakes on AgM-DS are mainly attributed to the decline of surface areas. As for the reference samples of 1.6AgM-WI and 1.6AgM-SG, 56.0, 19.4 cm3 g-1 of C2H4 and 17.8, 13.9 cm3 g-1 of C2H6 are captured, respectively. Both the adsorbents display higher C2H4 uptakes than C2H6. However, compared with optimal 1.6AgM-DS, the C2H4 uptakes are much lower. Moreover, significant smaller uptake distinctions between C2H4 and C2H6 are discovered.
  </p>
  <p>
   To further evaluate the C2H4/C2H6 separation performances of the adsorbents, the selectivity was investigated based on IAST. The isotherms of the adsorption branches derived from experiments were well fitted with the DL model (lines in Figure S2), and the fitting parameters in Table S1 were employed for calculating the IAST selectivity. As shown in Figure 5, the C2H4/C2H6 selectivity at 100 kPa gradually decreases with the increasing C2H4 molar fraction in mixtures. Over the whole range of the C2H4 molar fraction, the pure MIL-101 indicates the lowest C2H4/C2H6 selectivity. It is noteworthy that confining AgNO3 inside MIL-101 (AgM-DS) dramatically improves the values. In detail, for an equimolar C2H4/C2H6 gas mixtures, the selectivity of AgM-DS is up to 4.4-9.9, whereas a value of only 1.1 is obtained on MIL-101. When referring to other AgNO3-loaded adsorbents, compared with 1.6AgM-DS (9.5), the selectivity of 1.6AgM-WI (8.1) and 1.6AgM-SG (1.8) is much lower.
  </p>
  <p>
   To gain more insights into the interactions between C2H4 and adsorbents, the isosteric heat of adsorption (Qst) was investigated based on the isotherms at two operating temperatures, 25 and 35 °C (Figure S3). The adsorption isotherm at 35 °C was also fitted with DL model (lines in Figure S4) as those aforementioned at 25 °C, and the fitting parameters were displayed in Table S2. It is depicted in Figure 6 that the zero-coverage Qst value of C2H4 on 1.6AgM-DS is 59.2 kJ mol-1, significantly higher than that of pure MIL-101 (9.0 kJ mol-1). The results confirm the construction of π-complexation bonds between C2H4 and guest Ag(I) sites in 1.6AgM-DS, which apparently boosts their interactions compared with the van der Waals' forces in pure MIL-101.
  </p>
  <p>
   On the basis of above results on sorption and selectivity performances, it can be concluded that pure MIL-101 can hardly capture C2H4 from C2H4/C2H6 mixtures. Introduction of AgNO3 onto MIL-101 and construction of π-complexation sites is imperative for driving the separation processes. The stronger interactions of π-complexation bonds compared with van der Waals' forces between C2H4 and Ag(I) sites endow the AgNO3-modified adsorbents with abilities to separate C2H4/C2H6. Furthermore, a comprehensive investigation reveals that simple combination of AgNO3 with MIL-101 does not guarantee a high performance. Among the AgNO3-loaded adsorbents, 1.6AgM-DS displays the highest ability on C2H4/C2H6 separation, including both C2H4 capacity and C2H4/C2H6 selectivity as compared to 1.6AgM-WI and 1.6AgM-SG. The outstanding performances of 1.6AgM-DS should be correlated with the location of AgNO3, that is, inside MIL-101, resulting in the good AgNO3 dispersion. On 1.6AgM-WI and 1.6AgM-SG, the aggregation of AgNO3 species at the outer surface of MIL-101 leads to poor dispersion and thus inferior performances.

  <h2>
   Stabilities of Ag(I) Sites in Adsorbents
  </h2>
  <p>
   In the practical applications, not only separation ability but also the stability of the Ag(I) π-complexation adsorbents are critical. Although the stabilities of Ag(I) sites are a well-known problem, there have been rare studies on how to directly improve the stabilities of Ag(I) sites. As the Ag(I) compound, like AgNO3, is not stable under light irradiation, the optimal 1.6AgM-DS was exposed to natural light for a certain time to explore its stability. The sorption isotherms are exhibited in Figure S5, and the corresponding C2H4 capacities are presented in Figure 7. The fresh 1.6AgM-DS adsorbs 75.5 cm3 g-1 of C2H4 at 100 kPa. 1.6AgM-DS is still capable to capture 72.5 cm3 g-1 of C2H4 after 1 week, which is close to the fresh sample. On further exposure for 2 and then 3 weeks, the C2H4 adsorption capacities of 1.6AgM-DS are 68.2 and 67.9 cm3 g-1, respectively. Notably, 90% of the fresh capacity has been retained. Under natural light for 4 weeks, the C2H4 uptake of 1.6AgM-DS is 61.3 cm3 g-1, only 81% of the fresh adsorbent. Taking the above observations into account, we conclude that the 1.6AgM-DS adsorbent is able to hold 90% of fresh adsorption amount under natural light irradiations for 3 weeks, suggesting a high stability of 1.6AgM-DS. The regeneration of the adsorbent is also a great concern in practical applications. The experiment of the stability of adsorption-desorption for C2H4 on 1.6 AgM-DS was conducted. After each cycle, 1.6AgM-DS was degassed at 105 °C for 4 h. As shown in Figure S6, after five cycles, 1.6AgM-DS has no obvious decrease on C2H4 uptake, indicating good stability of adsorption-desorption for C2H4.
  </p>
  <p>
   In order to track the conditions of Ag(I) sites after exposure to natural light irradiations, XPS analysis was performed. Figure 8 illustrates that the Ag(I) signals are well defined on fresh 1.6AgM-DS at a binding energy of 368.5 and 374.5 eV. They are assigned to Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2, respectively. This proves the presence of AgNO3 in 1.6AgM-DS once again. It is surprising to see that after light irradiation, the Ag(I) signals have no obvious changes, indicating the high stability of AgNO3. As we know, under light irradiation, AgNO3 is easy to decompose and transform into Ag. In the process of C2H4/C2H6 separation, AgNO3 rather than Ag can show the π-complexation activity to preferably adsorb C2H4 from C2H6. That is to say, the light irradiations will cause the instability of AgNO3. It is expected that if the effect of the light irradiation on AgNO3 can be reduced, its stability will be improved. As for the 1.6AgM-DS, AgNO3 locates at the interior of MIL-101; thus, the MIL-101 shell serves as an umbrella to reduce the light irradiation on AgNO3. As a result, the high stability of AgNO3 in 1.6AgM-DS can be related to the location of AgNO3, which is inside MIL-101.
  </p>
  <p>
   The unique location of AgNO3 in 1.6AgM-DS gives rise to both good separation ability and high stability. To gain a better understanding, some adsorbents for C2H4/C2H6 separation are listed in Table 2 for comparison. The optimal 1.6AgM-DS in this work shows a C2H4 capacity of 75.5 cm3 g-1 and C2H4/C2H6 selectivity of 9.5. This adsorbent based on Ag(I) sites surpasses those of Cu(I) materials, for example CuA10B1 (39.6 cm3 g-1, 3.8) and Cu(I)@MIL-101 (56 cm3 g-1, 6.8). The C2H4 uptake of 1.6AgM-DS is also much higher than those reported for Ag(I) π-complexation adsorbents, including NUS-6(Hf)-Ag (45.2 cm3 g-1) and MIL-101-SO3Ag (63 cm3 g-1). In consideration of the selectivity, 1.6AgM-DS still exhibits a better performance than NUS-6(Hf)-Ag (6) and comparable to MIL-101-SO3Ag (9.7). In addition, 1.6AgM-DS is a little inferior to the best Ag(I) π-complexation adsorbent of PAF-1-SO3Ag (91.8 cm3 g-1, 27). It is notable that 1.6AgM-DS is able to retain 90% of fresh capacity, which is not studied on NUS-6(Hf)-Ag, MIL-101-SO3Ag, and only studied for 2 days (100% of fresh capacity) on PAF-1-SO3Ag. It is generally accepted that the stability of the Ag(I) sites in π-complexation adsorbents counts a great deal in their practical applications. Thereby, some adsorbents without π-complexation sites are also employed for C2H4/C2H6 separation. Although unstable π-complexation sites are not the concern of these materials, their performances are far from satisfactory. For instance, for NUS-36, both the C2H4 uptake (33.6 cm3 g-1) and selectivity (4.1) are much lower than 1.6AgM-DS. With regard to some MOFs containing open metal sites, such as Mg-MOF-74, Co-MOF-74, and HKUST-1, remarkably high C2H4 capacities (over 150 cm3 g-1) are obtained. However, low selectivity (less than 7) indicates its incompetence in C2H4/C2H6 separation. These findings confirm that 1.6AgM-DS has a better performance than a majority of recently reported adsorbents.

   Conclusions
  </h2>
  <p>
   In summary, good performances in C2H4/C2H6 separation were achieved by AgM-DS through controlling over the location of AgNO3 at the interior of MIL-101. Thanks to the confinement of the nanopores, AgNO3 inside MIL-101 possessed good dispersion. The well-dispersed AgNO3 allowed the resulting AgM-DS to show enhanced performances in both C2H4 uptakes and C2H4/C2H6 selectivity, compared with AgM-WI and AgM-SG loaded AgNO3 at the exterior of MIL-101. In addition, MIL-101 in AgM-DS played the role of a shell to reduce the destructive effects of natural light irradiation on AgNO3. Therefore, good stability for 3 weeks was realized on AgM-DS. This study, concentrating on the location of the active sites, proposes a new way to design and fabrication of metal species on MOFs.
