   1 Introduction
  </h2>
  <p>
   Energy consumption and environment degradation are dilemmas in recent industry and society since fossil energy has dominated market share. Among the available fossil energies, natural gas, which consisted primarily of methane and varying amounts of C2H6, C3H8, H2O, CO2, etc.. was deemed to be a preferable alternative fuel since it is naturally abundant and environmentally friendly compared to petrol and diesel. (1, 2) Pyrolysis gas, the main source of small hydrocarbons, also contains large amounts of methane. Since small hydrocarbons (C2-C3), such as acetylene, ethylene, and ethane, are basic feedstock in the petrochemical industry, it is essential to separate such light hydrocarbons from methane to fully utilize them. However, the traditional cryogenic distillation method for the light hydrocarbons separation not only is very energy-consuming but also requires harsh work conditions, such as high pressure and/or low temperature. Hence, an advanced and energy-efficient separation technology is highly desirable. Among the several newly developed separation methods, adsorptive separation is a cost- and energy-efficient method.
  </p>
  <p>
   Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), which can be straightforwardly self-assembled from organic linkers and metal ions/clusters, have been intensively investigated for applications in gas storage and separation. (3, 4) Very recently, MOFs have also been employed as a new kind of solid sorbents for separation of light hydrocarbons. (5-8) Several strategies, including tailoring pore surface function, tuning pore size and shape, and utilizing structural flexibility, have been adopted to enhance the efficiency of the gas selective adsorption and separation. (9-12) Among them, the pore sizes and shapes of the MOFs sorbents are first and foremost for their separation performance. The pore size of an adsorbent which is comparable to or slightly larger than the kinetic diameters of the adsorbates will significantly promote the separation selectivity of these light hydrocarbons. Hence, the design and synthesis of MOFs with narrow pores close to 4.4 Å are crucial for their performances in the separation of these light hydrocarbons as the light hydrocarbons (C1-C3) kinetic diameters range from 3.3 to 4.4 Å. (8, 12, 13) In addition, tailoring pore surface function, such as the immobilization of polar functional groups -OH, -NH2, and/or the formation of charge skeletons, is another effective strategy to improve the MOFs' separation efficiency based on adsorbate-surface interactions. (11, 14-16) Charged MOFs constructed by polar phosphorus-based ligand have usually been exploited for selective separation for CO2 from CH4 or N2; however, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time we use this type of MOF for selective separation of light hydrocarbons. (16-18) Along this line, we have designed and synthesized a novel ligand, 5,5′-(hydroxyphosphoryl)diisophthalic acid (H5hpdia), to construct microporous MOFs for the selective separation of light hydrocarbons (C1-C3). Since the largest distance between P and C in H5hpdia is 5.260 Å, the pore sizes of the expected MOFs may be close to the kinetic diameters of light hydrocarbons by assumption that both the carboxylate and the O═P-OH are connected to the zinc center, which are highly desirable for MOFs' applications in the separation of light hydrocarbons. Herein, based on H5hpdia, we synthesized a new 3D MOF (denoted as FJI-C4, FJI is short for Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter, the C in FJI-C4 stands for the Cao group) with a square pore size of ca. 5.9 × 5.9 Å2. The as-prepared anionic MOF FJI-C4 exhibits extraordinarily high selectivity of light hydrocarbons (C2-C3) as well as CO2 with respect to methane at room temperature. The selectivity of FJI-C4 for C3H8/CH4 and C2H2/CH4 is comparable to those of FJI-C1 (19) and higher than JLU-Liu22. (20) Additionally, FJI-C4 is water-stable and may be a promising candidate for selective separation of methane toward natural gas and pyrolysis gas.

   2.1 General Experimental Chemicals and Methods
  </h2>
  <p>
   The starting reagents and solvents were ordered commercially and directly used in the experiments. The H5hpdia ligand was synthesized according to the reported method (Supporting Information Scheme 1) and characterized by 1H NMR spectrum under room temperature on a BRUKER AVANCE III spectrometer. The single crystal structure of FJI-C4 was solved by the SHELXTL software package using direct methods with difference Fourier techniques. (21) The disordered guest molecules in FJI-C4 were eliminated by the SQUEEZE program in PLATON. (22) The purity of FJI-C4 was confirmed by X-ray powder diffraction patterns, which were recorded on a MiniFlex 600 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å) under room temperature. TG (Thermogravimetric) analysis data were collected on an SDT Q600 analyzer from 20 to 1000 °C (10 °C min-1) in N2 gas. (23) The C, H, and N content of FJI-C4 was determined on a Vario MICRO EL III elemental analyzer. Infrared (IR) spectrum was collected on a PerkinElmer Spectrum by using the sample of FJI-C4 diluted by KBr in the region of 400-4000 cm-1. The N2, H2, CO2, and light hydrocarbons adsorption data were obtained on an ASAP 2020 equipment.

   Description of Single Crystal Structure
  </h2>
  <p>
   Single-crystal X-ray diffraction study reveals that FJI-C4 crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pbcn space group. The asymmetric unit of FJI-C4 contains one crystallographically independent zinc(II) atom and one H5hpdia ligand locating at the C2 axis (Figure S2). Each zinc(II) atom is coordinated by one phosphate oxygen atom and four carboxylate oxygen atoms (Figure 1a). Every hpdia5- ligand takes its four carboxylate and one phosphate groups to link to five separate zinc Secondary Building Units (SBUs). The adjacent zinc cations were connected by two carboxylate groups and a phosphate group to form a negatively charged aircraft-like dinuclear SBU. As far as we know, this anionic aircraft-like zinc SBU [Zn2(COO)4(POO)]- is unprecedented, which serves as nodes to propagate the skeleton of FJI-C4. Thus, the interconnection of the zinc SBUs with V-shaped ligand H5hpdia composes an anionic infinite framework with square channels along the crystallographic c-axis. The channels with a size of 5.9 × 5.9 Å2 were occupied by free solvents and highly disordered Me2NH2+ cations (Figure 1c). For clarity, the phenyl rings from the ligands are viewed as 3-connected nodes, while the aircraft-like SBUs can be regarded as 6-connected nodes. Topological analysis using TOPOS software indicates that FJI-C4 can be regarded as a 3, 6-connected dinodal net as of apo topology with the point symbol of {4 62}2{42 69 84}. PLATON analysis shows that the effective free volume of FJI-C4 is about 52.1% of the crystal volume (1521.0 Å3 out of the 2920.7 Å3 unit cell volumes).

   Gas Adsorption and Separation Properties
  </h2>
  <p>
   To investigate the permanent porosity of FJI-C4, N2 and CO2 sorption experiments were carried out. The N2 sorption isotherm of FJI-C4 at 77 K shows a reversible typical type-I isotherm as expected for microporous materials. Derived from N2 sorption isotherm, the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area and the Langmuir surface area of FJI-C4 are 690 m2 g-1 and 781 m2 g-1, respectively. A narrow distribution of micropores at appropriate 5.5 Å is calculated by the Horvath-Kawazoe method (Figure 2), which is slightly smaller than the value derived from the single crystal structure. The pore volume from t-plot analysis is 0.27 cm3 g-1, which is also smaller than the theoretical value from a single crystal structure (0.44 cm3 g-1); these discrepancies can be explained by the existence of disorder Me2NH2+ counteractions occupied in the pores of FJI-C4. Since CO2 is a dominant component of greenhouse gas and a main contaminant of natural gas, it is meaningful to investigate the capacity for CO2 and selectivity of CO2/CH4. Low pressure CO2 sorption isotherms were also measured at 273 and 298 K (Figure S9). The amount of CO2 uptake for FJI-C4 is 111.0 cm3 g-1 (21.8 wt %) at 273 K and 60.3 cm3 g-1 (11.2 wt %) at 298 K under 1 bar, respectively. Compared with the enormous MOFs, the amount of MOFs which exhibit over 20.0 wt % CO2 uptakes at 273 K and 1 bar is relatively small. (24, 25) The heat of adsorption (Qst) for CO2 in FJI-C4 ranges from 22 kJ mol-1 to 35 kJ mol-1 calculated by the Clausius-Clapeyron equation (Figure S10).

   Considering the small pore size, charged skeleton, and intrinsic permanent porosity of FJI-C4, we have investigated its potential application for light hydrocarbons adsorption and separation. Although many MOFs with excellent gas sorption capacity (such as H2, CO2, and CH4) have been reported, only a few MOFs show high sorption capacity and selectivity toward light hydrocarbons. To examine the sorption and separation of light hydrocarbons of FJI-C4, single component gas sorption isotherms of FJI-C4 for various light hydrocarbons (CH4, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, and C3H8) were performed both at 273 and 298 K. As expected, FJI-C4 can take up a high amount of C3H8 (74.7 cm3 g-1), C2H2 (82.8 cm3 g-1), C2H6 (73.4 cm3 g-1), and C2H4 (70.1 cm3 g-1) but a relatively lower amount of CH4 (32.7 cm3 g-1) at 273 K and 1 bar (Figure 3a). It should be noted that the sorption capacity of FJI-C4 for C3H8 (71.5 cm3 g-1), C2H2 (72.5 cm3 g-1), C2H6 (66.3 cm3 g-1), C2H4 (61.4 cm3 g-1), and CH4 (18.4 cm3 g-1) at 298 K and 1 bar are higher than those of UTSA-35a and UTSA-36a (Figure 3b). (8, 13) The magnitude of the adsorption enthalpies reveals the affinity of the pore surface toward adsorbents, which plays a significant part in determining the adsorptive selectivity. (23) To evaluate the affinity of such light hydrocarbons in FJI-C4, the heats of adsorption were calculated by the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. The adsorption enthalpy for CH4, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, and C3H8 were in the range of 20.8-23.1 kJ mol-1, 27.0-31.7 kJ mol-1, 33.1-42.6 kJ mol-1, 32.7-40.9 kJ mol-1, and 31.1-42.9 kJ mol-1, respectively (Figure S11).

   The C2-C3 light hydrocarbons with higher adsorption enthalpy may provide stronger affinity with a skeleton, which results in these gases being preferentially adsorbed on a skeleton of FJI-C4. Thus, it may have high selectivity of C2-C3 light hydrocarbons with respect to CH4. Therefore, the potential for separation of methane from C2-C3 light hydrocarbons has been appraised by ideal solution adsorbed theory (IAST) for binary equimolar components (Figure 3c). At 1 bar and 298 K, the selectivities of C3H8, C2H2, C2H4, and C2H6 with respect to CH4 are 293.4, 51.0, 22.1, and 39.7, respectively. These calculated selectivities are higher than the corresponding values of USTA-35a, JIU-Liu22, and many other reported MOFs (Table S1). (15, 26-29) Remarkably, the selectivity of C3H8/CH4 on FJI-C4 ranges from 293.4 to 469.7, which is nearly equivalent to the current highest values of FJI-C1 (range from 78.7 to 471). (19) The results indicate that FJI-C4 is a prospective absorbent for effectively selective adsorptive separation of CH4 from C2-C3 hydrocarbons at room temperature. It should be noted that, for equimolar gas-phase mixtures at 1 bar, the predicted CO2/CH4 selectivity by IAST is 12.4 at 273 K and 8.0 at 298 K (Figure S12 and Figure S13), respectively, which is comparable to QI-Cu and outperforms Cu3(BTC)2, JLU-Liu5. (30-32) Such high selectivities further imply that FJI-C4 has considerable potential natural gas purification. The high adsorption selectivity of C2-C3/CH4 could be attributed to three factors: (i) the narrow pore size of FJI-C4 matches with the kinetic diameters of C2-C3 light hydrocarbons resulting in their high C2-C3/CH4 sieving effects; (ii) the charged skeleton and cationic counterions (Me)2NH2+ enhance adsorbent-adsorbate interaction through charge-induced force, whereas C2-C3 light hydrocarbons as well as CO2 generate stronger interactions between adsorbent-adsorbate due to their higher polarizability compared with CH4; and (iii) π-π interactions of benzene rings of FJI-C4 toward acetylene and ethene may improve their adsorption capacities. (11, 19, 20, 33-35) The polarizability and quadrupole moment of these gases are shown in Table S2.

   Water-Stable and Thermal-Stable Properties
  </h2>
  <p>
   The water-stability and thermal-stability are prerequisites for the practical applications in natural gas purification and the adsorptive separation of light hydrocarbons. Factors influencing structural stability of MOFs in water include basicity of the ligand, metal-ligand bond strength, type of metal center and coordination number oxidation state of the metal center, chemical functionality of the linker, etc. (36) To date, in order to improve the water-stability of MOFs, several methods have been explored in previous work, for instance, mimicking of the zeolite structure such as ZIFs and using of high charged metal centers, such as Cr3+, Ti4+, and Zr4+ to build MOFs. (37, 38) The zinc-based water-stable MOFs, however, are rare. Remarkably, FJI-C4 exhibits extraordinary water-stability when immersed in deionized water and even in boiling water (Figure S14). As we know, the phosphonates form stronger bonds than carboxylates do with metal atoms and try to synthesize phosphonate-based MOFs as a promising way to obtain stable MOFs. (39) In our case, the water-stable FJI-C4 may benefit from the stronger coordination bonds between the metal and phosphorus-containing ligands. Therefore, the unprecedented zinc-based water-stable [Zn2(COO)4(POO)]- may serve as a platform for the design and synthesis of new zinc-based water-stable MOFs. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) performed on the as-prepared FJI-C4 reveals that materials underwent a continuous weight loss below 250 °C, which can be ascribed to the loss of all free molecules. Thereafter, the weight remains almost constant until the framework begins to collapse at 390 °C. These observations suggest FJI-C4 is water-stable and thermal-stable and can be a potential candidate for real application.

   4 Conlusion
  </h2>
  <p>
   In summary, we have developed and characterized a new microporous MOF FJI-C4 based on a predesigned phosphoryl carboxylate ligand. The zinc-based FJI-C4 is water-stable and thermal-stable. Moreover, FJI-C4 has just the right pore size of features to maximize interactions between gases and frameworks, so it exerts high separation selectivity for C2-C3 light hydrocarbons as well as CO2 with respect to CH4. These results indicate that FJI-C4 could be a promising candidate for fuel gas purification and separation of light hydrocarbons in the near future.
