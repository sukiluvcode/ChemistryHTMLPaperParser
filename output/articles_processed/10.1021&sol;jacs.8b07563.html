  <p>
   High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideThe separation of ethane from its analogous ethylene is of great importance in the petrochemical industry, but very challenging and energy intensive. Adsorptive separation using C2H6-selective porous materials can directly produce high-purity C2H4 in a single operation but suffers from poor selectivity. Here, we report an approach to boost the separation of C2H6 over C2H4, involving the control of pore structures in two isoreticular ultramicroporous metal-organic framework (MOF) materials with weakly polar pore surface for strengthened binding affinity toward C2H6 over C2H4. Under ambient conditions, the prototypical compound shows a very small uptake difference and selectivity for C2H6/C2H4, whereas its smaller-pore isoreticular analogue exhibits a quite large uptake ratio of 237% (60.0/25.3 cm3 cm-3), remarkably increasing the C2H6/C2H4 selectivity. Neutron powder diffraction studies clearly reveal that the latter material shows self-adaptive sorption behavior for C2H6, which enables it to continuously maintain close van der Waals contacts with C2H6 molecules in its optimized pore structure, thus preferentially binds C2H6 over C2H4. Gas sorption isotherms, crystallographic analyses, molecular modeling, selectivity calculation, and breakthrough experiment comprehensively demonstrate this unique MOF material as an efficient C2H6-selective adsorbent for C2H4 purification.

   Introduction
  </h2>
  <p>
   Separation and purification of chemical mixtures are energy-intensive processes currently in the chemical industry that take up substantial cost. Several bulk chemical commodities involving the light olefins, such as ethylene (C2H4) and propylene (C3H6), are the cornerstone of many important manufacturing, exceeding a worldwide production of 200 million tonnes. (1) To separate ethylene from its analogous ethane of very similar molecular size and volatility, a typical industrial process highly relies on heat-driven cryogenic distillation through repeated distillation-compression cycles, which is one of the most energy-intensive technologies. The corresponding energy consumption for such separation is estimated to be about 7.3 GJ per tonne of ethylene. (2) Consequently, there is an urgent demand to explore alternative technologies and materials that can efficiently separate and purify these light hydrocarbons under mild conditions. It is well recognized that nonthermal separation technologies like adsorption-based or membrane-based ones can be more highly energy efficient than the cryogenic distillation technology. (3)
  </p>
  <p>
   Utilizing the differences of the molecular geometry and physical properties, porous materials can exhibit differential adsorption for various components of the mixture. (4) However, except for a few chemisorbents, (5) conventional porous materials show poor adsorption selectivity for hydrocarbons mixture due to the lack of recognition mechanism. As novel porous materials, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and/or porous coordination polymers (PCPs) have the advantage of designable structures with tunable pore sizes and diverse functionalities, (6) that enables them to show promise for a wide variety of applications in many important areas, (7) including olefin/paraffin separation. (8) The core of MOF chemistry lies in their construction approach, referring to the connections of specific building blocks over multiple dimensions via coordination bonds. Introduction of functional sites into MOFs can enhance binding interaction for polar hydrocarbons, while precise control over the pore sizes can exclude larger molecules, both resulting in improved separation performance. A series of important progresses have been achieved by using MOFs as porous media in the realms of C2H4/C2H6, (9) C2H2/C2H4, (10) C3H6/C3H8, (11) and C3H4/C3H6 separation. (12)
  </p>
  <p>
   For equilibrium separation via physical adsorption, the separation performance is determined by the host-guest interactions between the porous framework and the adsorbates, including dispersion and electrostatic interactions. (13) These interactions rely on the surface properties of the adsorbent and the nature of the adsorbate molecule, such as dipole moment, quadrupole moment, polarizability, and so on. (13) For adsorbents with highly polarized or high electric field gradient surfaces (e.g.. functionalized with open metal sites), the electrostatic interactions often dominate. Thus, gas molecules with high dipole and/or quadrupole moments are preferentially bound. (13,14) In contrast, for adsorbents with inert pore surfaces (e.g.. featuring aromatic or aliphatic moieties) like activated carbon, dispersion and induction interactions make major contributions, which are proportional to the polarizability of gas molecules. (13) Consequently, given the fact that C2H4 shows a larger quadrupole moment (C2H4: 1.50 × 10-26 esu cm2, C2H6: 0.65 × 10-26 esu cm2) while C2H6 has a larger polarizability (C2H4: 42.52 × 10-25 cm3, C2H6: 44.7 × 10-25 cm3), (14) MOFs used for C2H4/C2H6 separation can be cataloged into C2H4-selective MOFs (9a,b) and C2H6-selective MOFs. (15) The latter is proposed to be much more efficient for related separation, as it can simplify the separating process for high-purity C2H4 and thus cut down the corresponding energy consumption. (15a) The design strategies for C2H4-selective MOFs are relatively straightforward, that is, introducing highly polar binding centers like open metal sites or hydrogen-bonding acceptor to boost the selectivity. (9b,16) In contrast, owing to the lack of suitable strong binding site, C2H6-selective MOFs usually suffer from poor selectivity. Also, the C2H6/C2H4 uptake ratios of the benchmark C2H6-selective MOFs are just over 1, as they show quite similar capacities for both gases, (15) which limit their available capacities for ethane capture from C2H4/C2H6 mixture. A feasible strategy is to increase the efficient contact area or the quantity of interactions between C2H6 molecules and the host framework (forming multiple interactions), for which ultramicroporous MOFs are more favorable, but precise control on the pore chemistry is required.
  </p>
  <p>
   By virtue of the isoreticular principle in MOF chemistry, we were able to target two isoreticular ultramicroporous MOF materials, [Cu(ina)2] (Hina = isonicotinic acid; here termed as Cu(ina)2) and [Cu(Qc)2] (Qc-5-Cu-sql, (17) HQc = quinoline-5-carboxylic acid; here termed as Cu(Qc)2), to exhibit the control of pore chemistry for advancing C2H6/C2H4 selectivity. The accessible pore surface of these two MOFs mainly features aromatic rings of low polarity, enabling preferential binding of ethane over ethylene. Particularly, activated Cu(Qc)2 exhibits a smaller pore aperture size of about 3.3 Å, facilitating possible multiple adsorbent-adsorbate interactions in confined pore space, which motivated us to check its potential for C2H6/C2H4 separations. Gas sorption studies indicate that Cu(Qc)2 is clearly a ethane-selective adsorbent with a superior C2H6/C2H4 uptake ratio of 237% and selectivity of 3.4, which are much higher than those of its isoreticular analogue Cu(ina)2 with a larger pore. Direct crystallography studies reveal that C2H6 molecules can be well accommodated by the self-adaptive framework of Cu(Qc)2 with optimized pore structure, which can maximize the number of weak host-guest interactions and/or the corresponding close contact area. As a result, Cu(Qc)2 can preferentially capture C2H6 from the C2H6/C2H4 mixture under ambient conditions, affording a superior porous adsorbent for the challenging separation of C2H6/C2H4. Molecular modeling studies and experimental breakthrough have well supported the claim.

   Neutron Crystallography
  </h2>
  <p>
   Powder neutron diffraction data were collected using the BT-1 neutron powder diffractometer at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Center for Neutron Research. A Ge(311) monochromator with a 75° takeoff angle, λ = 2.0787(2) Å, and in-pile collimation of 60 min of arc was used. Data were collected over the range of 3-166.3° (2θ) with a step size of 0.05°. A fully activated Cu(Qc)2 sample was loaded in a vanadium can equipped with a capillary gas line and a packless valve. A closed-cycle He refrigerator was used for sample temperature control. The activated Cu(Qc)2 sample was measured first at the temperature of 298 K. To probe the gas adsorption locations, C2D6 and C2D4 (note that deuterated gas was used because H has a large incoherent neutron scattering cross section and thus would introduce large background in the diffraction data) were loaded into the sample at room temperature, and diffraction data were then collected on the gas-loaded MOF samples. Different C2D6 loadings into Cu(Qc)2 were realized by controlling the loading pressure.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rietveld structural refinement was performed on the neutron diffraction data using the GSAS package. (19) Due to the large number of atoms in the crystal unit cell, the ligand molecule and the gas molecule were both treated as rigid bodies during the Rietveld refinement, with the molecule orientation and center of mass freely refined. Final refinement on the positions/orientations of the rigid bodies, thermal factors, occupancies, lattice parameters, background, and profiles converged with satisfactory R-factors.

   Results and Discussion
  </h2>
  <p>
   Considering the pore sizes and physical properties of the pore surface, copper isonicotinate (Cu(ina)2) was chosen as the prototype MOF. (18) To introduce large organic moieties for further control over the pore chemistry, ligands with extra aromatic rings were targeted to construct isoreticular structures. Quinoline-4-carboxylic acid and quinoline-5-carboxylic acid have met such requirements. However, there is no accessible pore volume in copper quinoline-4-carboxylate, (20) so only copper quinoline-5-carboxylate (Cu(Qc)2) (17) was accordingly evaluated with Cu(ina)2. In both MOFs, each Cu(II) atom is coordinated by two pyridyl/quinoline groups (with two N atoms) and two carboxylate groups (with four O atoms), which is expanded to four adjacent Cu(II) atoms through two-connected ligands, affording square lattice (sql) coordination network (Figure 1a-b). The layered networks further stack together through π-π interactions. As-synthesized samples were prepared under solvothermal conditions, and their phase purity was confirmed through comparing their experimental PXRD patterns with the corresponding simulated ones from single crystal data (Figures S1-2, see Supporting Information). After guest removal from the as-synthesized samples, both structures of Cu(ina)2 and Cu(Qc)2 shrink to more dense phases, exhibiting one-dimensional (1D) channels with aperture sizes of ~4.1 and ~3.3 Å (void space of 22.3% and 17.2%, cavity size of 5.4 × 5.8 × 6.3 and 4.7 × 6.1 × 6.6 Å3), respectively (Figures 1c and S3). The accessible pore surfaces of these two MOFs are mainly occupied by low polarity aromatic rings. Consequently, such ultramicroporous structures are particularly promising for preferential ethane accommodation, considering that their low-polarity pore surfaces are more favorable for ethane molecules of larger polarizability (Table S2).
  </p>
  <p>
   The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface areas of activated Cu(ina)2 and Cu(Qc)2 were measured to be 228 and 240 m2/g (Langmuir surface area: 260 and 290 m2/g), respectively, by CO2 sorption experiment at 195 K (Figure S4). Their total pore volumes were measured to be 0.10 and 0.11 cm3/g, which is a little lower than the theoretical pore volumes from corresponding crystal structures (0.15 and 0.12 cm3/g), owing to slightly insufficient filling of CO2 on the undulating pore surfaces.
  </p>
  <p>
   The inert pore surface and suitable pore size of Cu(ina)2 and Cu(Qc)2 provide us the initial motivation to evaluate their C2H6 and C2H4 sorption performance. Hence, low-pressure C2H6 and C2H4 sorption data under ambient conditions were collected (Figure 1d). Indeed, Cu(ina)2 shows ethane-selective sorption behavior, with uptake capacity of 67.4 cm3 cm-3 (1.99 mmol g-1) for C2H6 and 64.3 cm3 cm-3 (1.90 mmol g-1) for C2H4 at 298 K and 1 bar, giving a C2H6/C2H4 uptake ratio of 105%. In contrast, for Cu(Qc)2, with smaller pore aperture sizes and featuring larger aromatic π systems, more distinct ethane-selective sorption performance can be observed under the same condition (Figure 1d). Cu(Qc)2 shows uptake capacity of 60.0 cm3 cm-3 (1.85 mmol g-1) for C2H6 and 25.3 cm3 cm-3 (0.78 mmol g-1) for C2H4 at 298 K and 1 bar, giving a C2H6/C2H4 uptake ratio of 237%, which is higher than those of other MOF materials (Table S3). (15,21) The adsorption of relatively large gas molecules into Cu(Qc)2 with smaller pore aperture indicates the dynamic nature of such structure. The C2H6 uptake capacity of Cu(Qc)2 is comparable to benchmark MAF-49 (1.73 mmol g-1) and ZIF-7 (1.83 mmol g-1) (Table S3). (15,21) Notably, according to the amount of adsorbed C2H6 in Cu(Qc)2 and the corresponding pore volume, the density of encapsulated C2H6 in the pore channels at 298 K is up to 464 g/L, which is about 380 times as gaseous C2H6 density of 1.22 g/L (298 K, 1 bar) and close to the liquid C2H6 density of 543 g/L (184.6 K, 1.01 bar), implying the highly efficient packing of ethane molecules in Cu(Qc)2. In fact, the introduction of large substituted organic moieties can reduce the pore volume, resulting in a decrease of gas uptake capacity in the absence of strong adsorption sites. Indeed, the larger quinoline moieties in Cu(Qc)2 dramatically lowered its uptake capacity for C2H4. Surprisingly, they showed negligible effect on that of C2H6, as indicated by cycling sorption measurements (Figures S5-6). Obviously, the only thing can be foreseen is that strengthened interactions happen between ethane molecules and the framework of Cu(Qc)2.
  </p>
  <p>
   To make a quantitative comparison of these different interactions in Cu(Qc)2, modeling studies based on first-principles dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT-D) were conducted. Primarily van der Waals (vdW) interactions can be found after loading of C2H6 molecules into the framework of Cu(Qc)2. The calculated static adsorption energy (ΔE, only involving the host-guest interactions) for C2H6 is 37.6 kJ mol-1. In contrast, the ΔE for C2H4 is significantly lower and only 23.1 kJ mol-1, which implies a weaker host-guest interaction. Simultaneously, coverage-dependent adsorption enthalpies (Qst) of Cu(Qc)2 for C2H6 and C2H4 were evaluated experimentally from pure component isotherms collected at 273, 298, and 313 K, by using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation (Figures S7-8). The resultant Qst for C2H6 at near-zero coverage is 29 ± 2 kJ mol-1, involving the host-guest interactions for C2H6 and certain endothermic framework distortions, which certainly is higher than that of 25.4 kJ mol-1 for C2H4. At higher coverage, the adsorption enthalpy for C2H6 is maintained on 30-31 kJ mol-1, while that for C2H4 is only 24-25 kJ mol-1. In addition, the Qst of Cu(ina)2 for C2H6 and C2H4 is 26.5 and 25.8 kJ mol-1, respectively (Figures S9-10), which is fully consistent with the variation of their polarizabilities and adsorption uptakes. Obviously, the larger difference of the adsorption enthalpies for C2H6 and C2H4 can result in the larger C2H6/C2H4 uptake ratio. Hence, for C2H6 and C2H4 molecules, their binding affinity from the inert surface relies on the variation of efficient contact area or interactions number, which is very sensitive to the pore structure.
  </p>
  <p>
   To visualize and structurally understand these host-guest interactions, we carried out high-resolution neutron powder diffraction (NPD) measurements to determine the binding conformations of C2H6 and C2H4 molecules in Cu(Qc)2. The loading amounts of both gases were controlled by their backfill pressure. High-quality NPD data of the gas-loaded Cu(Qc)2 samples were collected at room temperature (Figures S11-12), in which the conformation of gas molecules were successfully identified. As shown in Figure 2, based on the data of [Cu(Qc)2] 0.41C2D6, there is only one crystallographically independent C2D6 molecule in the pore systems. Specifically, C2D6 molecule locates in a rhombic cavity formed by aromatic rings (mainly refers to rings 1-4 in Figure 2c) of ligands from the same layered network, giving a sandwich structure as viewed along two adjacent rhombic edges. The C2D6 occupancy was determined by free structural refinement to be 0.413(5), which is equivalent to 1 mmol g-1 (sealed at 0.4 bar), as consistent with that from the gas sorption experiment (1.1 mmol g-1). Compared with the bare Cu(Qc)2, the unit cell of [Cu(Qc)2] 0.41C2D6 exhibits certain expansion and slight deformation (ΔV/Vbare = 2.9%, Δβ = 0.6°). As expected, multiple C-D π interactions (D π 2.34(3)-3.34(3) Å, C-D π 3.22(3)-4.16(3) Å) were found between each C2D6 molecule and the aromatic rings within the rhombic cavity, most of which are shorter than the sum of the vdW radii of hydrogen/carbon (1.20/1.70 Å) and carbon (1.70 Å) atoms. It should be noted that weakly polar C-H π interactions are more like weaker interactions dominated by dispersion, as compared to other intermolecular hydrogen-bond-like interactions (i.e.. O-H π and N-H π), all of which make essential contributions to biomacromolecules structure. (22) The interaction energy of a typical C-H π interaction is calculated to be only 6.1 kJ mol-1. (23) Nevertheless, the optimized cavity of Cu(Qc)2 fits well with the molecule shape of C2H6, which enables the binding for C2H6 through multiple C-H π interactions come into reality. It can be identified from the C2D6 loaded structure where the ethane molecule with staggered conformation contributes five of its six hydrogen atoms to form C-H π interactions.
  </p>
  <p>
   In contrast, prepared under the same conditions, the structure of [Cu(Qc)2] 0.16C2D4 exhibits a negligible structural deformation (ΔV/Vbare = 0.9%, Δβ = 0.1°, see Figure S13). The C2D4 occupancy from free refinement is only 0.155(5). The C2D4 molecule shows short contacts with only two parallel edges of the rhombic cavity (Figure 2d), giving a similar sandwich structure. Similar clear C-D π interactions (D π 2.51(12)-2.92(12) Å, C-D π 2.94(12)-3.33(12) Å) were also found between each C2D4 molecule and the aromatic rings. Obviously, although all four hydrogen atoms of ethylene molecule are involved in the C-H π interactions, its lower adsorption heat ( ~ 6 kJ mol-1 less than that for C2H6) can be attributed to the less involved hydrogen atoms as compared to ethane. Accordingly, for ethane, the more C-H π interactions and higher occupancy indicate its higher binding affinity.
  </p>
  <p>
   To well understand the sorption behaviors, the structure of high C2D6-loading sample [Cu(Qc)2] 0.67C2D6 was also measured (Figure S14). The same preferential binding site with higher C2D6 occupancy of 0.666(6) was determined from this data. Besides, a slightly larger structural deformation (ΔV/Vbare = 4.1%, Δβ = 0.9°) can be observed, showing self-adaptive behavior for different C2H6 loadings. The same hydrogen atoms formed multiple C-H π interactions (D π 2.410(4)-3.186(4) Å, C-D π 3.289(4)-4.052(4) Å) with the aromatic rings inside the rhombic cavity, while no noticeable adsorbate-adsorbate interaction can be found. Notably, comparing with the low loading structure, C2D6 molecule in [Cu(Qc)2] 0.67C2D6 forms closer contacts with the third aromatic ring (Figure 2c, ring 3, D π3 2.844(5)-3.186(4) Å, C-D π3 3.595(5)-4.052(4) Å), which is consistent with the trend of adsorption enthalpy, and further demonstrates such optimized pore structure is competent to accommodate ethane molecules.
  </p>
  <p>
   Comparison of the crystal structures with different C2D6 loadings further illustrates the self-adaptive adsorption behavior of Cu(Qc)2 (Figure 2e-f). The framework structure shows continuous swelling and deformation upon the increased loading of C2H6, which can be attributed to the close-range repulsion effect (one of contributions to adsorbate-adsorbent interaction potentials, (13) also the origin of common steric hindrance effect) as well as the dynamic nature of coordination framework. Interestingly, upon increasing the amount of adsorbed C2D6 molecules, the distance between rings 1 and 2 (dπ1-π2) is swelling, whereas that between rings 3 and 4 (dπ3-π4) is shrinking owing to the attractions of ethane molecule. Such distinct self-adaptive behavior of the host framework can continuously maintain the close vdW contacts with ethane molecules. On the other hand, the vdW surface area of C2H6 (75 Å2) is clearly higher than that of C2H4 (61 Å2), which is a prerequisite for larger adsorbate-adsorbent close contact area and/or more corresponding interactions to happen, thus boosting the ethane binding affinity of Cu(Qc)2.
  </p>
  <p>
   Motivated by the large C2H6/C2H4 uptake ratio and preferentially binding of ethane molecules, the selectivity calculation was performed based on the ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST, Figures S15-24), which can evaluate the potential of Cu(Qc)2 for ethane removal from the C2H4/C2H6 mixture. As expected, the calculated C2H6/C2H4 selectivity of Cu(Qc)2 for the corresponding binary equimolar mixture is up to 3.4 at 298 K and 100 kPa, which is higher than that for any other top-performing MOF material of ethane selective (Figure 1e-f, Table S3). (15,21) In contrast, the C2H6/C2H4 selectivity of Cu(ina)2 under the same condition is only 1.3, as indicated by its gas isotherms and uptake ratio. Obviously, by virtue of pore engeering to precisely control the pore structure, the resultant MOF material can exhibit not only high uptake ratio but also high selectivity for ethane removal from C2H4/C2H6 mixture. In addition, activated Cu(Qc)2 shows remarkable moisture stability under 98% relatively humidity (Figure S25). The results fully support the potential of Cu(Qc)2 in practical C2H6/C2H4 separation at ambient pressure.
  </p>
  <p>
   To further evaluate the C2H6/C2H4 separation performance of Cu(Qc)2 in practical adsorption process, we carried out experimental breakthrough studies in which the C2H6/C2H4 mixture was flowed over a packed column of activated adsorbent with a rate of 2 mL per min at 298 K (see Supporting Information). As shown in Figure 3, complete separation of C2H6 from C2H6/C2H4 mixture can be realized at ambient conditions by using activated Cu(Qc)2. C2H4 can be first detected from the outlet effluent gas during initial purges, showing a desirable purity of over 99.9%, while no detectable C2H6 was found. Then, after the adsorbent became saturated in the dynamic mixture flow, C2H6 reached its breakthrough point, giving a C2H4 productivity of 587 mmol/L sorbent. Obviously, by using C2H6-selective adsorbents, the desirable high-purity C2H4 can be directly obtained in a single separating operation, which greatly simplifies the separation process of these important petrochemicals.

   Conclusion
  </h2>
  <p>
   In summary, we report a simple approach to explore ethane-selective MOFs for superior ethane separation technology to advance ethylene production. In principle, the introduction of highly polar binding sites onto the pore surface of MOFs will facilitate their binding affinity for more polar molecules like ethylene, giving ethylene-selective adsorbents. For the much more challenging design of ethane-selective MOFs, strong binding sites are hardly available, whereas increasing the efficient contact area or the quantity of interactions is more applicable. By virtue of pore engineering, we can successfully target an inert ultramicroporous material with optimized pore structure, which realizes highly ethane-selective sorption behavior. The self-adaptive pore structure in this MOF can maximize the quantity and contact area of adsorbate-adsorbent interactions, resulting in larger binding affinity for ethane over ethylene, which is well supported by direct crystallography studies. This approach will facilitate future design and implementation of efficient porous MOF materials for separating important chemicals.
